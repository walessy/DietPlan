To create a **Friday-to-Wednesday menu plan** based on the **Autophagy-Boosted Weekly Meal Plan** with the lectin-free adjustments (e.g., using cauliflower instead of red bell peppers, incorporating kale, tuna, and seaweed for variety and iodine), I’ll adapt the original structure to cover six days (Friday through Wednesday). The plan will maintain the 16:8 intermittent fasting window (12 PM–8 PM eating), low-carb, high-fat, lectin-free approach to support **autophagy**, **nerve health** (e.g., for MS), and **digestive comfort** (low-FODMAP, bloating prevention). It will incorporate the implemented solutions for the identified gaps (Vitamin C, electrolytes, protein variability, caloric intake, sustainability, iodine) while ensuring all foods are low-lectin or lectin-free.

The menu will:

- Use **cauliflower** (75g, ~40mg vitamin C) 3x/week for Vitamin C.
- Increase **avocado** (1.5 per lunch 3x/week) and add an **electrolyte drink** (salt + cream of tartar) for potassium.
- Vary protein with **tuna** (2x/week), **chicken livers** (1x/week, if sourced), and **sardines/mackerel**.
- Boost calories with extra **olive oil** (4 tbsp 3x/week) and **fish portions** (1.5 tins 2x/week) for active individuals.
- Enhance sustainability with **kale** (2x/week) and **dried herbs** (3x/week).
- Add **seaweed snacks** (2x/week) for iodine.
- Keep the budget ~£7.30–£7.60/day (~£44–£46 for 6 days, adjusted for fewer days).

Below is the **Friday-to-Wednesday menu plan**, followed by a shopping list and practical tips. I’ll assume you’re following the same daily routine (morning ritual, fasting, magnesium) and store notes (Tesco/Morrisons, chicken livers from butcher or salmon as backup). If you have specific preferences (e.g., no eggs, higher calories, or other restrictions beyond lectins), please clarify.

## Practical Tips

**Preparation**:

- **Batch Steam**: Steam cauliflower (225g), broccoli (750g), spinach (600g), and kale (150g) in one session (10–15 min); portion into 75g containers. Freeze extra to prevent spoilage.
- **Seeds**: Grind flaxseeds (1–2 weeks’ worth) and store in an airtight jar in the fridge. Soak 1 tbsp chia seeds in 50ml water for 10 min before lunch or prep 3–4 tbsp in bulk (refrigerate 2–3 days).
- **Livers/Tuna**: If using chicken livers, sauté 100g in 1 tbsp olive oil (5–7 min); freeze extras. Drain tuna/sardines but keep oil for omega-3s.
- **Electrolyte Drink**: Mix 500ml water with ¼ tsp salt + ½ tsp cream of tartar daily in a reusable bottle; sip during fasting.

**Constipation Relief**:

- Increase olive oil to 2 tbsp AM + 2 tbsp PM if needed.
- Sip 100ml warm water with 1 soaked prune + 1 tbsp soaked chia seeds.
- Add 1 tsp psyllium husk to water if persistent; avoid overdoing prunes.

**Lectin Avoidance**:

- All foods (cauliflower, kale, broccoli, spinach, pumpkin, blueberries, fish, eggs, livers, seeds) are low-lectin or lectin-free when steamed, soaked, or ground.
- Avoid high-lectin foods (beans, grains, raw nightshades). If sensitive, peel avocados (lectins in skin, negligible in flesh) or soak pumpkin seeds overnight.

**Monitoring**:

- Track energy, neuropathy symptoms (tingling, numbness), digestion (bloating, bowel movements), and taste satisfaction in a journal for 1–2 weeks.
- Note cramps (use banana or increase cream of tartar to ¾ tsp). If bloating occurs, reduce cauliflower/kale for 1 day.
- For pre-menopausal women, ensure chicken livers/salmon 1x/week for iron; track menstrual cycle.

**Benefits**:

- **Autophagy**: 16:8 fasting + low carbs (~30–40g/day) + high fat (~70–80% calories) promotes ketosis and cellular cleanup.
- **Nerve Health**: Omega-3s (fish, flax, chia), B12 (sardines, eggs), D (sardines), and magnesium support myelin and reduce inflammation.
- **Bloating**: Low-FODMAP, steamed vegetables, and probiotics (sauerkraut) minimize digestive issues.
- **Energy**: ~1300–1600 kcal/day with extra oil/fish supports active individuals.

### Notes on Adjustments

- **Days Covered**: The plan spans Friday to Wednesday (6 days) as requested. If you meant a different range (e.g., including Thursday), let me know.
- **Lectin-Free**: Cauliflower, kale, and other additions (tuna, livers, seaweed, herbs) are low-lectin, aligning with your concern about avoiding lectins in red bell peppers.
- **Gaps Addressed**:
  - **Vitamin C**: Cauliflower 3x/week (~120mg/week) + lemon juice/blueberries (~50–70mg/day) = ~90–110mg/day.
  - **Electrolytes**: 1.5 avocados 3x/week + cream of tartar (~250mg potassium/day) = ~2000–2500mg potassium/day.
  - **Protein**: Tuna (2x/week), livers (1x/week), sardines/mackerel vary sources (~40–50g/day).
  - **Calories**: Extra oil (3x/week) + 1.5 tins fish (2x/week) = ~1300–1600 kcal/day.
  - **Sustainability**: Kale (2x/week) + herbs (3x/week) add variety.
  - **Iodine**: Seaweed 2x/week (~200µg) + salt/fish (~40–70µg/day) = ~120–150µg/day.
- **Budget**: Adjusted for 6 days (~£44–£46 vs. original ~£51–£53 for 7 days), maintaining ~£7.30–£7.60/day.

If you need a specific day tweaked (e.g., no fish on Wednesday), a nutrient breakdown (e.g., total omega-3s, iron), or help with sourcing (e.g., butcher for livers), let me know. Would you like the plan in a specific format (e.g., Markdown, PDF) or additional tips (e.g., recipes, batch prep schedule)?
