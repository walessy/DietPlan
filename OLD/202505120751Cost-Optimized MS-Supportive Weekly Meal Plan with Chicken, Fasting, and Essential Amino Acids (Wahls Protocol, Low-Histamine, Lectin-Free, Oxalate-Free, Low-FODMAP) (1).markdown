# Introduction

This cost-optimized 7-day meal plan (Friday to Thursday, May 9–15, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 63.5 kg, aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) to support MS management through nutrient-dense foods, delivering ~102g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg body weight, ~51g/meal), ensuring all 9 essential amino acids (EAAs: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine) and Vitamin B12 (~2.5–3.0µg/day, ~104–125% RDA: 2.4µg). It supports leaky gut repair, constipation, bowel-bladder interactions, acidic sensations, neuropathic pain, post-antibiotic gut issues, and MS-specific needs (e.g., nerve health, inflammation reduction). The plan aligns with the video *"Ultimate Protein Guide: Lose Weight Faster (How Much You REALLY Need)"* ([https://youtu.be/hHkxBEQaZdY](https://youtu.be/hHkxBEQaZdY)), recommending ~1.2–2.0 g/kg protein and emphasizing the 9 EAAs (*Am J Clin Nutr.*, 2015; *Adv Nutr.*, 2017), and incorporates a **16:8 intermittent fasting schedule** (12 PM–8 PM eating window, two meals at 12 PM and 6 PM) based on evidence that fasting reduces inflammation and regulates immunity in MS (*Neurosci News*, 2018; *Nat Commun.*, 2018), with high protein to mitigate muscle loss concerns for those over 40 (*J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci.*, 2017; *J Nutr.*, 2014). The plan uses only whole chicken (for meat and bones) and chicken breasts, with all but one whole chicken frozen upon purchase (Friday) and defrosted strategically to ensure low-histamine compliance. All chicken is cooked fresh daily or consumed immediately after cooking, with no reheating of cooked meat to prevent histamine formation, and excess meat is frozen within 2 hours (*SIGHI*, 2023; *Food Microbiol.*, 2018). Bone broth (~2800ml, 14 x 200ml portions) is prepared solely from ~1400g bones of two whole chickens, frozen immediately, defrosted daily, and heated once to 165°F/74°C. A detailed schedule guides defrosting and cooking of raw chicken and bone broth to align with meal consumption. The plan includes ~9 cups/day raw vegetables (~4.5–6 cups cooked, ~600–800g): ~3 cups greens (kale), ~3 cups sulfur-rich (cabbage), ~3 cups colorful (peeled carrots, cucumber, peeled white potato, apple), all oxalate-free (<10mg/100g cooked), lectin-free (peeled where needed), and low-FODMAP, plus anti-inflammatory fats (olive oil), seasoned with turmeric. Parsley is used sparingly (~25g/week, ~25–37.5mg oxalates, negligible). The morning ritual includes lemon juice for Vitamin C and alkalizing effects. Nutrient-dense foods provide ~340–390mg magnesium/day, ~90–120µg iodine/day, and ~25–30g fiber/day (including resistant starch), supporting constipation, nerve health, and MS symptoms per Wahls Protocol (*The Wahls Protocol*, 2020). Some nutrients (iodine, magnesium, calcium, Vitamin D, omega-3s) fall below RDA or AI due to dietary constraints (low-histamine, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP) and cost optimization, requiring monitoring or supplementation (e.g., consult neurologist for Vitamin D, low-histamine fish oil for omega-3s). The plan adheres to low-FODMAP, low-histamine, lectin-free, and oxalate-free principles, ensuring all ingredients are gluten-free, dairy-free, and aligned with Wahls Protocol. Kale intake (~86g/day cooked, ~0.66–0.73 cups cooked, ~3 cups raw) is safe for oxalates (~0.69–4.81mg/day), goitrogens (~14–21mg/day), fiber (~1.7g/day), and Vitamin K (~275–412µg/day, monitor if on anticoagulants), and contains no Vitamin B12, with B12 sourced from chicken and eggs (*cookingpro.net*, 2023; *Nutrients*, 2018). The journal (Saturday, May 10: cooked 1.6kg whole chicken, 12 AM; ate ~400g chicken meat, 30g kale, 2 eggs, 400g sweet potato, 100g butternut squash, 100g cucumber, no broth/olive oil, felt full; 1:42 PM: 2 eggs, no olive oil) is incorporated, adjusting for whole chicken (~900g meat, ~700g bones), reduced kale, delayed broth/olive oil, and replacing sweet potato with peeled white potato and butternut squash with cabbage. The plan targets a budget of ~£56–£59 (~£8–£8.40/day), optimized to ~£54.61 by using cost-effective whole chicken (~£3.31/kg) and chicken breasts (~£6.45/kg), minimizing expensive ingredients (e.g., seaweed snacks, zucchini), including ~£4.70 delivery fee (total ~£59.31, within ~£84.14 receipt).

## Nutritional Standards

The plan meets or exceeds the **Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)** and **Adequate Intakes (AI)** set by the **National Academy of Medicine (NAM)** for males aged 51–70, aligned with UK dietary reference values (NHS, Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition) and **The Wahls Protocol**’s focus on nutrient density for MS support, adjusted for cost optimization, low-histamine (no reheating of cooked meat), lectin-free, oxalate-free (<10mg/100g cooked, parsley negligible), low-FODMAP requirements, and intermittent fasting. The **RDA** is the average daily intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97–98%) healthy individuals in a specific age and sex group, as defined by the NAM. The **AI** is a recommended average daily intake level based on observed or experimentally determined estimates, used when an RDA cannot be established, as defined by the NAM. The plan adheres to **low-FODMAP** principles (Monash University) for gut sensitivity, **ketogenic/low-carb** targets (~60–80g carbs/day) for autophagy/mitophagy enhanced by fasting, **low-histamine** and **lectin-free** principles to minimize symptoms, and supports leaky gut repair (glutamine, zinc, prebiotics), constipation (high fiber), inflammation (anti-inflammatory fats, omega-3s), nerve health (magnesium, B12, Vitamin D), and MS mitochondrial function per Wahls Protocol (*The Wahls Protocol*, 2020). Some nutrients fall below RDA/AI due to dietary constraints and cost; these are noted with monitoring recommendations. Key standards include:

- **Protein**: ~102g/day (~1.6 g/kg for 63.5 kg, RDA: 56g, NAM 2005), ~182% RDA, exceeds RDA for muscle, gut, nerve repair, and satiety, ensuring all 9 EAAs (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine) via complete proteins (chicken, eggs) to counter fasting-related muscle loss and support MS per Wahls.
- **Fat**: ~120–150g/day (~70–80% calories), aligns with ketogenic diet and Wahls’ healthy fat focus for autophagy/mitophagy, prioritizing anti-inflammatory fats from olive oil.
- **Carbohydrates**: ~60–80g/day (~35–45g net carbs), supports ketosis, below AI (~130g, NAM 2005) but sufficient for MS energy needs during fasting, with Wahls’ emphasis on vegetable-based carbs.
- **Fiber**: ~25–30g/day (AI: 30g, NAM 2005), slightly below AI due to cost-driven vegetable selection, supports constipation and leaky gut with ~10–12g soluble fiber and ~1–2g/day resistant starch from peeled white potato.
- **Vitamin C**: ~140–160mg/day (156–178% RDA, 90mg, UL: 2000mg), exceeds RDA for gut health, immune support, and Wahls’ antioxidant needs.
- **Potassium**: ~3900–4500mg/day (115–132% AI, 3400mg, UL: none), exceeds AI for hydration, nerve function, and Wahls’ mineral focus.
- **Iodine**: ~90–120µg/day (~60–80% RDA, 150µg, UL: 1100µg), below RDA due to reduced seaweed snacks and non-iodized salt constraint, monitor thyroid function, consider low-histamine iodine sources (e.g., iodized salt if constraint allows).
- **Calcium**: ~390–590mg/day (39–59% RDA, 1000mg, UL: 2500mg), below RDA due to no dairy and vegetable constraints, monitor bone health, consult neurologist for supplementation.
- **Magnesium**: ~340–390mg/day (81–93% RDA, 420mg, UL: 350mg supplemental, none dietary), below RDA due to cost-driven vegetable reduction, monitor nerve health and constipation, consider magnesium-rich low-FODMAP foods (e.g., pumpkin seeds if tolerated).
- **Vitamin B12**: ~2.5–3.0µg/day (~104–125% RDA, 2.4µg, UL: none), meets/exceeds RDA for nerve health critical for MS and Wahls’ B-vitamin focus.
- **Vitamin D**: ~0.8–1.3µg/day (~5–9% RDA, 15µg, UL: 100µg), below RDA, requires monitoring or supplementation for MS support and Wahls’ immune focus, consult neurologist.
- **Vitamin A**: ~800–1000µg/day (~89–111% RDA, 900µg, UL: 3000µg), meets RDA for gut lining repair, immune function, and Wahls’ antioxidant needs.
- **Vitamin K**: ~250–400µg/day (AI: 120µg, UL: none), exceeds AI, safe unless on anticoagulants, monitor for MS patients on warfarin per Wahls’ caution.
- **Zinc**: ~9–13mg/day (82–118% RDA, 11mg, UL: 40mg), meets/exceeds RDA for gut/nerve health and Wahls’ immune support.
- **Iron**: ~1–2mg/day (~13–25% RDA, 8mg, UL: 45mg), below RDA but adequate for males due to low bleeding risk, supports MS nerve health.
- **Sodium**: ~600–800mg/day (46–62% AI, 1300mg, UL: 2300mg), sufficient for low-carb hydration during fasting.
- **Omega-3s (ALA)**: ~0.24–0.34g/day (below AI: 1.6g, UL: none), below AI due to absence of fatty fish/seeds, consider low-histamine fish oil if tolerated for MS inflammation and Wahls’ neuroprotection focus.
- **Anti-Nutrients**: No lectins (peeled vegetables), oxalates (<10mg/100g cooked, parsley ~25–37.5mg/week negligible), phytates, or saponins, maximizing absorption for leaky gut and MS support per Wahls’ clean-eating principles.

## Daily Routine

**Morning Ritual (7 AM)**:
- Warm water with 75ml lemon juice (37.5mg Vitamin C, oxalate-free) + 300ml water (alkalizing, diluted to minimize bladder irritation).
- Hydration: 3L water throughout the day (for stool softening and urine dilution to reduce MS-related bladder urgency during fasting, aligns with Wahls’ hydration focus).
- Non-Dietary: Diaphragmatic breathing (5 min, 2x/day) to relax pelvic floor; stand/walk 5–10 min/hour to improve pelvic circulation, adjusted for MS-related mobility as needed, supporting Wahls’ stress reduction.

**Fasting Schedule**: 16:8 intermittent fasting with a 12 PM–8 PM eating window (fasting 8 PM–12 PM), two meals/day at 12 PM (lunch) and 6 PM (dinner) to distribute ~102g protein (~51g/meal), ~120–150g fat, and ~1500–1600 kcal, supporting MS inflammation reduction and immune regulation (*Neurosci News*, 2018) while meeting Wahls’ nutrient density.

**Non-Dietary Tip**: Use a footstool (e.g., Squatty Potty) during bowel movements to reduce straining and ease bowel-bladder crosstalk, beneficial for MS (*Physi
