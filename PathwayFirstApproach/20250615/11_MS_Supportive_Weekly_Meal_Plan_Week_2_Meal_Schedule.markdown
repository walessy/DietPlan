# Week 2 Meal Schedule

This ADHD-friendly guide provides the Week 2 meal schedule for the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan, designed to support MS and ADHD with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient foods. Meals are simple (2–5 min daily prep), dexterity-friendly (no peeling/chopping), and use **colorful** plates and **creamy/crunchy** textures for psychological engagement. The schedule aligns with **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips** and supports nerve health (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), and focus.

## Week 2 Overview

- **Goal**: Deliver ~115 g protein/day (Plan A, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal), ~100 g/day (Plan B, ~2.0–3.0 g leucine/meal), ~1.5–2.0 mg/day thiamine (Plan A), ~1.0–1.5 mg/day (Plan B), and ~25g/day fiber, activating 16 pathways (e.g., autophagy, neuroprotection) with no-chicken proteins.
- **Key Foods**: Parsnip, Brussels sprouts, turnip, celery root, carrots; tuna, shrimp, turkey, tempeh; raspberries, bananas, flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds; white rice, kefir, tart cherry juice, lemon water.
- **Prep**: Sunday batch prep (1h 10m) boils vegetables (7–10 min, ~40% oxalate reduction), soaks seeds (8h, ~50% phytate reduction), bakes proteins, portions lemon slices; daily microwave reheating (2–5 min), per **6 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Managing Antinutrients for Optimal Nutrition**.
- **Fasting**: 16:8 (10 AM–6 PM) default; 12:12 (8 AM–8 PM) for high-fatigue days, with alarms for meal timing.

- **Tracking**: Log symptoms (e.g., “Improved focus today”) and digestion in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking** to adjust portions (e.g., +100g vegetables for fiber).
- **Customization**: Swap berries (e.g., blueberries for raspberries) using **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template**.
- **Cognitive Health**: Supports cognitive health via flavonoids in raspberries, green tea, and tart cherry juice, as detailed in **4 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Simplified Menu**.

## Why It Works

The Week 2 schedule delivers ~25g/day fiber, high-leucine proteins, and thiamine-rich foods, supporting nerve repair (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), and ADHD focus. With fasting, low-antinutrient prep, and **colorful** meals, it activates all 16 pathways. For guidance, see:
