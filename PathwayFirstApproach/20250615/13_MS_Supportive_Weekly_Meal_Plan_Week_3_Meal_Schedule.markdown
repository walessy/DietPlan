# Week 3 Meal Schedule

This ADHD-friendly guide provides the Week 3 meal schedule for the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan, designed to support MS and ADHD with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient foods. Meals are simple (2–5 min daily prep), dexterity-friendly (no peeling/chopping), and use **colorful** plates and **creamy/crunchy** textures for psychological engagement. The schedule aligns with **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips** and supports nerve health (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), and neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**).

## Week 3 Overview

- **Goal**: Deliver ~115 g protein/day (Plan A, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal), ~100 g/day (Plan B, ~2.0–3.0 g leucine/meal), ~1.5–2.0 mg/day thiamine (Plan A), ~1.0–1.5 mg/day (Plan B), ~25g/day fiber, ~350–400 mg/day magnesium, ~2200–2800 mg/day potassium, and ~600–700 IU/day vitamin D, activating 16 pathways (e.g., autophagy, neuroprotection) with no-chicken proteins.
- **Personalization**: Adjust portions for sex, age, and life cycle. For pregnant and lactating women, including teenagers, increase protein (~125–140 g/day), fiber (~28–29 g/day), folate (600–500 mcg/day), iron (27–10 mg/day), and calcium (1000–1300 mg/day). See **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle** for detailed guidance.
- **Key Foods**: Summer squash, cabbage, kohlrabi, green beans, celery root, sweet potato; sardines, scallops, tofu; blueberries, bananas, avocado; flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds; white rice, kefir, tart cherry juice, fortified almond milk, lemon water.
- **Prep**: Sunday batch prep (1h 10m) boils vegetables (7–10 min, ~40% oxalate reduction), soaks seeds/nuts (8h, ~50% phytate reduction), bakes proteins, portions lemon slices; daily microwave reheating (2–5 min), per **6 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Managing Antinutrients for Optimal Nutrition**.
- **Fasting**: 16:8 (10 AM–6 PM) default; 12:12 (8 AM–8 PM) for high-fatigue days, with alarms for meal timing.

## Notes
- **Plan B**: Substitute canned vegetables (e.g., cabbage, green beans, sweet potato), canned sardines, and quinoa (100g, ~2.8g fiber) for rice to reduce costs (~$84.59–$95.39). Omit almond milk, almonds, reduce sardines (3 times/week), rely on sun exposure (10–15 min/day) for vitamin D, per **4 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Simplified Menu**.
- **Nutrient Boost**: Increased sardines (5 times/week), pumpkin seeds (30g/day), added almonds (Plan A, 4 times/week), avocado (Plan A, 3 times/week), fortified almond milk (Plan A) for magnesium (~350–400 mg/day), potassium (~2200–2800 mg/day), vitamin D (~600–700 IU/day), per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **For Pregnant/Lactating Women (including teenagers)**:
  - Increase protein by adding +50g sardines or +100g tofu to lunches/dinners.
  - Add 100g soaked and boiled lentils (~181 mcg folate) to lunches for folate.
  - Substitute scallops or tofu with 100g sardines (~2.9 mg iron, ~383 mg calcium) 3–4 times/week.
  - Increase kefir to 200 ml in snacks for extra calcium.
  - Track in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking** (e.g., “600 mcg folate, 27 mg iron, pregnant teen”).
- **Fasting Flexibility**: For 12:12, shift meals to 8 AM (Breakfast), 11 AM (Lunch), 3 PM (Snack), 7 PM (Dinner), maintaining protein/leucine timing (**8 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Leucine/Protein Timing**).
- **Tracking**: Log symptoms (e.g., “Reduced numbness today”) and digestion in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking** to adjust portions (e.g., +100g vegetables for fiber).
- **Customization**: Swap berries (e.g., raspberries for blueberries) or thiamine sources (e.g., Marmite/Vegemite for nutritional yeast) using **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template**.

## Why It Works

The Week 3 schedule delivers ~25g/day fiber, high-leucine proteins, thiamine-rich foods, and enhanced magnesium, potassium, and vitamin D, supporting nerve repair (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**), and ADHD focus. With fasting, low-antinutrient prep, and **colorful** meals, it activates all 16 pathways. For guidance, see:
