# Customizable Template

This ADHD-friendly guide provides a customizable template for the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan, allowing users to adapt the 4-week diet plan to personal preferences while maintaining support for MS and ADHD. The template ensures compliance with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient foods, supporting nerve health (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), and neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**). It builds on **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, and **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule**.

## Why a Customizable Template Matters

- **MS**: Personalized meal plans accommodate dietary needs and fatigue levels, supporting nerve repair and energy, per **5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**.
- **ADHD**: Flexible routines reduce decision fatigue, enhancing adherence and focus, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Personalization**: Tailoring meals to sex, age, and life cycle (e.g., higher protein for males, increased folate for pregnant women) optimizes outcomes, detailed in **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle**.
- **Goal**: Enable users to modify meals while preserving the 16 pathways (e.g., autophagy, neuroprotection), as outlined in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.

## How to Use the Template

1. **Select Foods**:
   - Choose from approved food lists (below) to maintain ~25g/day fiber, ~115 g protein/day (Plan A, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal), ~100 g/day (Plan B, ~2.0–3.0 g leucine/meal), ~1.5–2.0 mg/day thiamine (Plan A), ~1.0–1.5 mg/day (Plan B), ~350–400 mg/day magnesium, ~2200–2800 mg/day potassium, and ~600–700 IU/day vitamin D.
   - Ensure no-chicken proteins and low-antinutrient foods, per **6 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Managing Antinutrients for Optimal Nutrition**.
2. **Plan Meals**:
   - Fill the template with 4 daily meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Snack, Dinner) within the fasting window (10 AM–6 PM for 16:8, 8 AM–8 PM for 12:12).
   - Include **colorful** vegetables/fruits and **creamy/crunchy** textures for engagement.
3. **Prep**:
   - Batch prep on Sunday (1h 10m): boil vegetables (7–10 min), soak seeds/nuts (8h), bake proteins, portion lemon slices.
   - Daily prep: 2–5 min, microwave-based, dexterity-friendly.
4. **Personalize for Your Needs**:
   - Adjust the template based on your sex, age, and life cycle stage. For example, pregnant and lactating women should increase protein, fiber, folate, iron, and calcium. See the 'Personalization for Pregnant and Lactating Women' section below for details.
5. **Track**:
   - Log symptoms, digestion, and nutrient intake in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking** to adjust choices.

## Personalization for Pregnant and Lactating Women

Pregnant and lactating women, including teenagers, have increased nutritional needs. To support these needs, consider the following adjustments:

- **Protein**: Increase portions of protein-rich foods like salmon, tofu, or tempeh. Aim for ~125–140 g/day.
- **Fiber**: Add extra vegetables or fruits to meals to reach ~28–29 g/day.
- **Folate**: Include folate-rich foods like lentils, broccoli, or asparagus. Aim for 600 mcg/day (pregnant) or 500 mcg/day (lactating).
- **Iron**: Add iron-rich foods like sardines or pair plant-based iron sources with vitamin C (e.g., lemon water) for better absorption. Aim for 27 mg/day (pregnant) or 9–10 mg/day (lactating).
- **Calcium**: Increase kefir or add calcium-fortified foods. Aim for 1000–1300 mg/day.

**Important**: Consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and to ensure all nutritional needs are met.
