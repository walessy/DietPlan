# MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Index

This index catalogs all articles in the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan series, designed to support MS and ADHD with 16:8 fasting, ~25g/day fiber, and low-antinutrient foods. It includes original articles with combined Plan A (premium ingredients) and Plan B (budget-friendly ingredients) content, as well as separated A/B variants for clarity. Use this guide to navigate meal schedules, shopping lists, and supporting resources for simple, dexterity-friendly meals with **colorful** plates and **creamy/crunchy** textures.

## Why Plan A and Plan B Exist

The MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan offers two distinct plans to cater to different needs and budgets while maintaining nutritional goals for MS and ADHD support:
- **Plan A (Premium)**: Uses high-quality, often fresh or frozen ingredients like salmon, avocado, almonds, and fortified almond milk to maximize nutrient density (e.g., ~115g protein/day, ~600–700 IU/day vitamin D). Ideal for those prioritizing premium sourcing, variety, or specific dietary preferences. Estimated cost: ~$135.93–$141.60/week.
- **Plan B (Budget-Friendly)**: Uses cost-effective alternatives like canned fish, canned vegetables, and quinoa to achieve similar nutritional targets (e.g., ~100g protein/day, relies on sun exposure for vitamin D) at a lower cost. Perfect for those seeking affordability or easier access to shelf-stable ingredients. Estimated cost: ~$84.59–$95.39/week.
Both plans deliver ~25g/day fiber, ~350–400 mg/day magnesium, and ~2200–2800 mg/day potassium, supporting nerve health, mitochondrial function, and neuromuscular signaling. The A/B variants (e.g., 9.A, 9.B) separate these plans for streamlined planning, while original articles (e.g., 9) combine them for flexibility.

## Overview
The series provides ADHD-friendly meal plans, preparation guides, and nutritional tips. Original articles (e.g., 9, 11) combine Plan A and Plan B, while A/B variants (e.g., 9.A/B) separate them for clarity. All plans align with **1 - Diet Plan Summary and Tips** and include daily prep guides for low-effort, low-antinutrient meals.
