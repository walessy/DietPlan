# Tracking

This ADHD-friendly guide outlines strategies for tracking symptoms, nutrient intake, and progress in the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan, enabling users to monitor and adjust the 4-week diet plan for optimal MS and ADHD management. Tracking supports adherence to 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient goals, enhancing nerve health (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), and neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**). It integrates with **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, and **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule**.

## Why Tracking Matters

- **MS**: Monitoring symptoms (e.g., fatigue, numbness) and nutrients (e.g., DHA, fiber, magnesium) helps identify improvements and adjust for flares, supporting nerve repair, per **5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**.
- **ADHD**: Tracking focus, energy, and routine adherence reinforces habits, improving cognitive outcomes, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Personalization**: Tracking ensures nutrient targets match sex, age, and life cycle needs (e.g., higher magnesium for males, increased folate for pregnant women), detailed in **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle**.
- **Goal**: Use simple tracking to optimize the 16 pathways (e.g., neuroprotection, circadian rhythm) and personalize the plan, as outlined in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.

## Tracking Strategies

1. **Symptom Tracking**:
   - **Purpose**: Monitor MS symptoms (fatigue, numbness, mobility) and ADHD symptoms (focus, impulsivity) to assess plan effectiveness.
   - **Method**: Write 1–2 sentences daily (e.g., “Less fatigue after salmon lunch, focus improved post-walk”) in a notebook or app (e.g., “MySymptoms” for MS, “Bearable” for ADHD).
   - **Frequency**: Daily, post-dinner (e.g., 5:30 PM) or morning routine (7:30 AM, post-lemon water).
   - **Implementation**: Note changes after meals, fasting, or exercise (**2 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Exercise Routine**), linking to foods (e.g., blueberries, flaxseeds).

2. **Nutrient Tracking**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensure ~25g/day fiber, ~115 g/day protein (Plan A, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal), ~100 g/day (Plan B, ~2.0–3.0 g leucine/meal), ~1.5–2.0 mg/day thiamine (Plan A), ~1.0–1.5 mg/day (Plan B), ~350–400 mg/day magnesium, ~2200–2800 mg/day potassium, ~600–700 IU/day vitamin D, and, for pregnant and lactating women, ~600–500 mcg/day folate, ~27–10 mg/day iron, ~1000–1300 mg/day calcium.
   - **Method**: Use an app (e.g., “Cronometer”) or manual log to track fiber, protein, thiamine, magnesium, potassium, vitamin D, folate (e.g., 100g lentils ~181 mcg), iron (e.g., 100g sardines ~2.9 mg), and calcium (e.g., 150 ml kefir ~180 mg).
   - **Frequency**: Weekly summary (Sunday, post-batch prep) or daily if adjusting portions.
   - **Implementation**: Compare intake to targets in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**, increase vegetable portions (e.g., +100g) if fiber <25g/day or nutrients fall short.
   - **Personalize for Your Needs**: Adjust nutrient targets based on your sex, age, and life cycle stage. For example, pregnant and lactating women should track folate, iron, and calcium to meet their increased needs. Consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice.

3. **Fasting and Routine Tracking**:
   - **Purpose**: Confirm adherence to 16:8 (10 AM–6 PM) or 12:12 (8 AM–8 PM) fasting and meal timing.
   - **Method**: Log meal times (e.g., “Breakfast: 10 AM, green tea, banana”) and fasting windows in a notebook or app (e.g., “Zero” for fasting).
   - **Frequency**: Daily, during morning routine (post-lemon water, 7:30 AM).
   - **Implementation**: Note deviations (e.g., “Ate at 7 PM, MS flare”) and adjust using **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.

4. **Sleep and Recovery Tracking**:
   - **Purpose**: Monitor sleep quality and recovery to support circadian rhythm and energy.
   - **Method**: Log sleep duration (e.g., “7 hours, felt rested”) and rest breaks/naps (e.g., “20 min nap, less fatigue”) in a notebook or app (e.g., “Sleep Cycle”).
   - **Frequency**: Daily, morning or evening.
   - **Implementation**: Link sleep improvements to tart cherry juice or mindfulness, per **7 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Sleep/Recovery**.

5. **Budget and Shopping Tracking**:
   - **Purpose**: Ensure cost-effectiveness (Plan A: ~$135.93–$141.60, Plan B: ~$84.59–$95.39).
   - **Method**: Record purchases and compare to **10 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Shopping List**, **12 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Shopping List**, **14 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Shopping List**, **16 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Shopping List**.
   - **Frequency**: Weekly, post-shopping (e.g., July 5, 2025 for Week 3).
   - **Implementation**: Note savings from canned options (Plan B) or bulk buys.
