# Exercise Routine

This ADHD-friendly guide outlines a low-impact exercise routine to support energy, focus, and mobility for MS and ADHD within the 4-week diet plan. Regular physical activity enhances mitochondrial function, reduces fatigue, and boosts dopamine, complementing the plan’s 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible for 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient framework.

## Why Exercise Matters

- **MS**: Gentle exercise improves energy, mobility, and mitochondrial efficiency, reducing fatigue and supporting nerve health, as outlined in **Nerve Health**.
- **ADHD**: Physical activity increases dopamine and enhances focus, aiding routine adherence, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Goal**: Incorporate 5–10 min daily exercises to activate pathways like mitochondrial function, neuroprotection, and circadian rhythm, supporting the 16 pathways in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.

## Exercise Routine

1. **Daily Light Stretching (5–7 min)**:
   - **Purpose**: Improves flexibility, reduces MS stiffness, and boosts ADHD engagement.
   - **Exercises**:
     - **Neck Rolls**: Gently roll neck clockwise, then counterclockwise (30 sec each).
     - **Shoulder Shrugs**: Lift shoulders to ears, hold 2 sec, release (10 reps).
     - **Seated Leg Extensions**: Sit, extend one leg, hold 5 sec, switch (10 reps/side).
     - **Arm Circles**: Extend arms, make small circles forward, then backward (30 sec each).
   - **Timing**: Post-breakfast (e.g., 10:30 AM after green tea, banana) or during morning routine (after lemon water, 7:30 AM), per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
   - **Tools**: Chair for seated exercises, no equipment needed for dexterity ease.

2. **Daily Walking or Marching (3–5 min)**:
   - **Purpose**: Enhances cardiovascular health, energy, and dopamine for MS/ADHD.
   - **Exercises**:
     - **Indoor Marching**: March in place, lifting knees gently (3 min, ~60 steps/min).
     - **Outdoor Walk**: Walk slowly around a safe, flat area (5 min, ~100–150 steps).
   - **Timing**: Flexible, e.g., after lunch (1:30 PM) or post-snack (3:30 PM) to leverage meal energy (e.g., blueberries, ~1.4g fiber).
   - **Tools**: Comfortable shoes, optional support (e.g., cane) for MS stability.

3. **Optional Mindfulness Movement (2–3 min, 2–3 times/week)**:
   - **Purpose**: Reduces stress, improves ADHD focus, and supports circadian rhythm.
   - **Exercises**:
     - **Seated Breathing with Arm Raises**: Inhale, raise arms overhead, exhale, lower arms (10 breaths).
     - **Gentle Torso Twists**: Sit, twist upper body left, then right, holding 5 sec (5 reps/side).
   - **Timing**: Evening (e.g., 5:30 PM before dinner) or morning routine, per **7 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Sleep/Recovery**.
   - **Tools**: Chair, quiet space.

## Integration with the Plan

- **Morning Routine**: Include 5-min stretching after lemon water (7:30 AM) to start the day, as recommended in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Meal Timing**: Schedule exercises post-meals (e.g., after breakfast or snack) to use energy from fiber-rich foods (e.g., bananas, flaxseeds in **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule**), supporting mitochondrial health (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**).
- **Tracking**: Log energy and focus after exercises (e.g., “Felt energized post-walk”) using **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**, adjusting duration (e.g., 3 min if fatigued).
- **Customization**: Adapt exercises (e.g., seated-only for MS flares) using **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template**.
- **Diet Support**: Foods like salmon (DHA) and pumpkin seeds (magnesium) in **10 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Shopping List**, **12 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Shopping List**, **14 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Shopping List**, **16 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Shopping List** enhance exercise benefits for MS/ADHD.
