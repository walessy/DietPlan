## Personalizing the Plan

Nutritional needs vary by sex, age, and life cycle (e.g., pregnancy, menopause, adolescence), impacting requirements for protein, fiber, vitamins, and minerals. This plan provides baseline targets suitable for most adults but should be tailored to individual needs to optimize MS symptom management (e.g., fatigue, spasticity) and ADHD focus. Key considerations include:

- **Sex**: Men typically need higher protein (e.g., 120–140 g/day vs. 100–115 g/day for women), magnesium (400–420 mg/day vs. 310–320 mg/day), and potassium (3400 mg/day vs. 2600 mg/day). Women may need more iron during reproductive years (monitor via **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**).
- **Age**: Older adults (>50 years) may require increased vitamin D (800 IU/day) and protein (1.2–2.0 g/kg body weight) to support muscle and bone health, while younger adults (19–30) may need less. Adjust via **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template**.
- **Life Cycle**:
  - **Pregnant or Lactating Women**: Need higher protein (~+25 g/day, ~125–140 g/day), fiber (~28–29 g/day), folate (600 mcg/day pregnant, 500 mcg/day lactating), iron (27 mg/day), and calcium (1000–1300 mg/day). Pregnant teenagers (14–18) have similar needs but require 1300 mg/day calcium for growth. Add folate-rich foods (e.g., 100g lentils, ~181 mcg, soaked), iron sources (e.g., 100g sardines, ~2.9 mg), and calcium sources (e.g., 150 ml kefir, ~180 mg) via **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template**.
  - **Menopausal Women**: Benefit from increased magnesium (~320–360 mg/day) for nerve health. Adolescents (14–18) need higher protein (~1.0–1.2 g/kg body weight) and calcium (1300 mg/day, monitor).
- **Implementation**: Use **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template** to adjust food portions (e.g., +100g salmon for protein/vitamin D, +100g lentils for folate in pregnancy). Track symptoms and nutrients in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking** (e.g., “600 mcg folate, pregnant teen, less fatigue”). Consult a healthcare provider for specific needs (e.g., pregnancy, chronic conditions). See **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle** for detailed guidance.

3. **Boost Fiber and Key Nutrients**:
   - **Fiber**: Add 100g vegetables (e.g., frozen cauliflower, ~1g fiber) if fiber <25g/day, or 100g raspberries (~3g fiber) for pregnant women (~28–29 g/day).
   - **Magnesium**: Include 30g pumpkin seeds (~160 mg) and 15g almonds (~40 mg, Plan A) daily.
   - **Potassium**: Add 100g avocado (~485 mg, Plan A) or 200g sweet potato (~694 mg) 3–4 times/week.
   - **Vitamin D**: Increase salmon to 5 times/week (~570 IU/100g) and add 100 ml fortified almond milk (~100 IU, Plan A) daily. Ensure 10–15 min sun exposure during walks (**2 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Exercise Routine**).
   - **Folate, Iron, Calcium**: For pregnant/lactating women, add 100g lentils (~181 mcg folate, soaked), 100g sardines (~2.9 mg iron), and 150 ml kefir (~180 mg calcium) daily, tracked in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**.
   - **Monitor**: Log digestion and nutrient intake (e.g., “600 mcg folate, 27 mg iron, pregnant teen”) in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**. Adjust for sex, age, life cycle per **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle**.
