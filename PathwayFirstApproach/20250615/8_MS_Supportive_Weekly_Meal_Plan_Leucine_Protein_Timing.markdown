# Leucine/Protein Timing

This ADHD-friendly guide explains the role of leucine and protein timing in the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan, designed to support MS and ADHD with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient foods. By optimizing leucine and protein intake, the plan supports muscle protein synthesis, nerve health (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), and neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**).

## Why Leucine and Protein Timing Matter

- **MS**: Adequate protein supports muscle maintenance and nerve repair, reducing fatigue and spasticity, per **5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**.
- **ADHD**: Protein supports neurotransmitter production and focus, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Personalization**: Protein needs vary by sex, age, and life cycle. For pregnant and lactating women, including teenagers, protein requirements are higher (~125–140 g/day) to support fetal development and milk production. Tailor protein intake and timing to individual needs, as detailed in **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle**.
- **Goal**: Optimize leucine and protein timing to activate pathways like mTOR and muscle protein synthesis, supporting the 16 pathways in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.

## Strategies for Leucine and Protein Timing

1. **Leucine-Rich Proteins**:
   - **Sources**: Include proteins with ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal (Plan A) or ~2.0–3.0 g (Plan B), such as salmon (100g, ~2.5g leucine), tofu (100g, ~2.0g), and eggs (2, ~1.2g).
   - **For Pregnant/Lactating Women (including teenagers)**: Increase protein to ~125–140 g/day by adding extra portions (e.g., +50g salmon or +100g tofu) to meals. Ensure leucine-rich proteins are distributed across all meals to support continuous muscle protein synthesis.

2. **Protein Distribution**:
   - **Timing**: Consume protein in 4 meals within the eating window (e.g., 10 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM for 16:8 fasting). For pregnant and lactating women, consider an additional protein-rich snack (e.g., 150 ml kefir, ~5g protein) to meet higher needs.
   - **Implementation**: Use meal schedules in **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule** as a guide.

3. **Fasting Considerations**:
   - **16:8 Fasting**: Ensure protein intake is sufficient during the eating window to support muscle maintenance. Pregnant and lactating women should prioritize protein-rich meals to meet increased demands.
   - **12:12 Option**: On high-fatigue days, use the extended eating window to space out protein intake, ensuring consistent nutrient supply.

4. **Nutrient Synergy**:
   - **Pairing**: Combine protein with fiber-rich vegetables (e.g., 300g zucchini, ~3g fiber) to support digestion and satiety. For pregnant women, include folate-rich vegetables like broccoli (300g, ~189 mcg folate) to meet daily needs.

## Integration with the Plan

- **Weekly Meals**: **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule** include leucine-rich proteins like salmon and tofu, with adjustments for pregnant and lactating women (e.g., +50g salmon).
- **Shopping**: **10 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Shopping List**, **12 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Shopping List**, **14 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Shopping List**, **16 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Shopping List** provide protein sources for Plan A (~$135.93–$141.60) and Plan B (~$84.59–$95.39).
- **Customization**: Adjust protein portions (e.g., +100g tofu for pregnant teens) using **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template** and **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle**.
- **Tracking**: Monitor protein intake (e.g., “140 g protein, pregnant, improved energy”) in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking** to ensure needs are met.

## Why It Works

By optimizing leucine and protein timing, the plan supports muscle maintenance, nerve repair, and focus. Tailored for sex, age, and life cycle, including pregnant teenagers, it activates mTOR and muscle protein synthesis pathways, complementing the 16 pathways. For guidance, see:
