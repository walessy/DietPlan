# Leucine/Protein Timing

This ADHD-friendly guide outlines strategies for optimizing leucine and protein intake timing in the 4-week diet plan to support muscle maintenance and neurological health for MS and ADHD. Proper protein distribution enhances nerve repair, energy, and focus, complementing the plan’s 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient framework.

## Why Leucine and Protein Timing Matter

- **MS**: Muscle preservation and nerve repair require adequate protein and leucine, an essential amino acid that stimulates muscle protein synthesis. Optimal timing reduces fatigue and supports mobility, as noted in **5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**.
- **ADHD**: Protein supports neurotransmitter production (e.g., dopamine), improving focus and reducing brain fog, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Goal**: Distribute protein and leucine intake evenly across meals to maximize absorption and support the 16 pathways (e.g., mTOR, neuroprotection) outlined in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.

## Strategies for Leucine and Protein Timing

1. **Protein Distribution**:
   - **Target**: 
     - **Plan A**: ~115 g protein/day, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal, spread across 4 meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Snack, Dinner).
     - **Plan B**: ~100 g protein/day, ~2.0–3.0 g leucine/meal, spread across 4 meals.
   - **Timing**: Consume protein every 3–4 hours within the eating window (10 AM–6 PM for 16:8, 8 AM–8 PM for 12:12) to maintain muscle synthesis and neurotransmitter support.
   - **Sources**: High-leucine foods include salmon (100g, ~2.5g leucine), eggs (2, ~1.2g leucine), tofu (100g, ~2.0g leucine), and tempeh (100g, ~2.2g leucine).
   - **Implementation**: Meals in **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule** provide balanced protein (e.g., salmon at lunch, eggs at dinner).

2. **Leucine Threshold**:
   - **Purpose**: Achieve ~2.0–3.5 g leucine per meal to trigger muscle protein synthesis, critical for MS muscle preservation and ADHD neurological health.
   - **Method**: Include 100–150g of high-leucine protein (e.g., salmon, tofu) per meal, supplemented by seeds (e.g., pumpkin, ~0.3g leucine/20g) for snacks.
   - **Implementation**: Leucine-rich foods are timed at 10 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, and 5 PM (16:8) or 8 AM, 11 AM, 3 PM, and 7 PM (12:12), per **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule**.

3. **Antinutrient Management**:
   - **Purpose**: Minimize phytates and oxalates to enhance protein and leucine absorption, supporting nerve and muscle function.
   - **Method**: Soak seeds (8h, ~50% phytate reduction) and boil vegetables (7–10 min, ~40% oxalate reduction), per **6 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Managing Antinutrients for Optimal Nutrition**.
   - **Implementation**: Soaked seeds and boiled vegetables accompany protein sources in meals, per **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule**.

4. **Fasting Alignment**:
   - **Purpose**: Time protein intake within fasting windows to optimize mTOR activation for muscle and nerve repair.
   - **Method**: Distribute protein across 4 meals within 10 AM–6 PM (16:8) or 8 AM–8 PM (12:12), avoiding late-night intake to support circadian rhythms.
   - **Implementation**: Meal schedules align with fasting, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**, with lemon water (7:30 AM) aiding morning hydration.

## Integration with the Plan

- **Weekly Meals**: **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule** include high-leucine proteins (e.g., salmon, tofu, eggs) and flaxseeds (15g/day, ~4g fiber, soluble) to support protein goals (~115 g/day Plan A, ~100 g/day Plan B).
- **Shopping**: **10 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Shopping List**, **12 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Shopping List**, **14 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Shopping List**, **16 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Shopping List** provide salmon, tofu, eggs, seeds, and lemons (500 ml juice or 7 lemons/week) for Plan A, with canned options for Plan B (~$130.93–$136.60 Plan A, ~$81.59–$92.39 Plan B).
- **Tracking**: Monitor muscle strength and focus (e.g., “Less fatigue after salmon lunch”) with **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**, adjusting protein portions if needed.
- **Customization**: Swap protein sources (e.g., sardines for salmon) using **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template** while maintaining leucine thresholds.
- **Sleep/Recovery**: Protein timing supports recovery, complementing **7 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Sleep/Recovery**.

## Why It Works

Optimizing leucine and protein timing supports muscle preservation and nerve repair for MS, while enhancing dopamine production for ADHD focus. Integrated with fasting and antinutrient management, it activates mTOR and neuroprotection pathways, ensuring sustained benefits. For detailed guidance, see:
