# Customizable Template

This ADHD-friendly guide provides a customizable template for the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan, allowing users to adapt the 4-week diet plan to personal preferences while maintaining support for MS and ADHD. The template ensures compliance with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient foods, supporting nerve health (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), and neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**). It builds on **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, and **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule**.

## Why a Customizable Template Matters

- **ADHD**: Flexible routines reduce decision fatigue, enhancing adherence and focus, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Goal**: Enable users to modify meals while preserving the 16 pathways (e.g., autophagy, neuroprotection), as outlined in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
