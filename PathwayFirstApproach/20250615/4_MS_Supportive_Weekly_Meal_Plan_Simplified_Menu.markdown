# Simplified Menu

This ADHD-friendly guide provides a simplified menu for the 4-week diet plan, offering Plan A (standard) and Plan B (budget-friendly) options to support MS and ADHD. The menus streamline meal planning while maintaining 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low antinutrients, ensuring neuroprotection, dopamine support, and dexterity ease. This article complements the detailed schedules in **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, and **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule**.

## Why a Simplified Menu Matters

- **MS**: Simplified menus reduce cognitive load, supporting energy management and nerve health through DHA-rich foods, as outlined in **5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**.
- **ADHD**: Streamlined meal plans enhance routine adherence, boosting focus via dopamine-supportive foods, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Goal**: Provide easy-to-follow menus that activate the 16 pathways (e.g., mitochondrial function, neuroprotection), supporting MS/ADHD with minimal prep, as detailed in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
