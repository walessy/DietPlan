# Food Selection Methodology

This article outlines the methodology for selecting foods in the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan series, designed for a 54-year-old male with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, also supporting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The series implements two idealistic dietary plans—Plan A (comprehensive, ~22 foods) and Plan B (simplified, ~18 foods)—to manage MS symptoms, enhance cognitive health, align circadian rhythms, combat neuropathy, optimize muscle health, improve sleep quality, and address poor gut motility. Food selection is tailored to user preferences: eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa/meat, and ~40 g/day soluble fiber for Bristol Type 3–4 stools. The methodology prioritizes nutrient density, low-histamine/low-oxalate profiles (SIGHI 0–1), nutrient timing (e.g., vitamin D3, K2 at 10 AM; magnesium glycinate at 7 PM), and dietary adjustments (quinoa reduction in Plan A; high soluble, low insoluble fiber in Plan B). It incorporates increased variability and neuropathy-targeting foods (e.g., salmon, lentils, sweet potatoes in Plan A; green peas, cabbage, green beans, butternut squash, blackberries, natto in Plan B). This article reflects updates as of June 21, 2025, aligning with **Articles 4.A–7.A, 8.B–10.B**, and pending **11.B** (**Artifacts 05, 07, 08, 13–14, 20, 23–25**).

## Selection Criteria

Food selection is based on the following criteria, ensuring compatibility with MS/ADHD, muscle health, sleep, neuropathy, and gut motility goals:

### 1. Nutrient Density
Foods are chosen for high levels of key nutrients supporting MS/ADHD, muscle health, sleep, and neuropathy:
- **Protein and Leucine**: ~100 g/day (Plan B) or ~115 g/day (Plan A) protein, ~10.4–12.2 g/day leucine for muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and cognitive function. Sources: eggs (~6 g protein/egg), sardines/mackerel (~25 g protein/100 g), tofu (~10 g protein/100 g), salmon/lentils (Plan A, ~22 g protein/100 g) (**Artifact 03**).
- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: ~1.5–3 g/day to reduce inflammation and support nerve health. Sources: sardines/mackerel (~0.75–1.5 g/100 g), salmon (Plan A, ~0.9–1.8 g/100 g) (**Artifact 14**).
- **Vitamin D3**: ~1000–2000 IU/day for immune modulation and muscle function. Sources: sardines (~250 IU/100 g), mackerel (~450 IU/100 g), eggs (~40 IU/egg) (**Artifact 13**).
- **Vitamin K2**: ~100 µg/day to direct calcium to muscles/bones. Source: natto (Plan B, ~100 µg/100 g) or supplement (**Artifact 13**).
- **Calcium**: ~1000–2040 mg/day for muscle contraction. Sources: tofu (~250 mg/100 g), kale (~150 mg/60 g), chia seeds (~90 mg/15 g), oat milk (Plan A, ~120 mg/100 g) (**Artifact 13**).
- **Magnesium**: ~450–534 mg/day for muscle relaxation, sleep, and motility. Sources: pumpkin seeds (~80 mg/15 g), green peas (~35 mg/100 g), avocado (~29 mg/100 g), lentils/quinoa (Plan A, ~32–36 mg/100 g); supplemented with glycinate (200–400 mg at 7 PM), citrate (100–200 mg at 10 AM) (**Artifact 13**).
- **Zinc**: ~9.8–11 mg/day for muscle repair and immunity. Sources: pumpkin seeds (~1 mg/15 g), sardines (~1 mg/100 g) (**Artifact 14**).
- **Vitamin B6**: ~1.8–2.3 mg/day for serotonin/melatonin synthesis and neuropathy. Sources: green peas (~0.2 mg/100 g), avocado (~0.5 mg/100 g), salmon (Plan A, ~0.6 mg/100 g) (**Artifact 14**).
- **Vitamin B12**: ~4–6 µg/day for nerve repair and sleep. Sources: sardines/mackerel (~1.5 µg/100 g), eggs (~0.5 µg/egg) (**Artifact 14**).
- **Tryptophan**: ~600 mg/day for melatonin production. Sources: pumpkin seeds (~100 mg/15 g), tofu (~150 mg/100 g), eggs (~75 mg/egg) (**Artifact 13**).
- **Flavonoids**: ~419–839 mg/day (Plan B), ~300–600 mg/day (Plan A) for anti-inflammatory effects. Sources: kiwi (~110 mg/100 g), blackberries (~75 mg/100 g), kale (~120 mg/60 g), strawberries/blueberries (Plan A, ~50 mg/100 g) (**Artifact 14**).

### 2. Low-Histamine and Low-Oxalate Profiles
Foods align with SIGHI 0–1 ratings to minimize histamine intolerance and oxalate-related inflammation, common in MS:
- **Examples**: Eggs, sardines, mackerel, tofu, kiwi, zucchini, green peas, cabbage, blackberries, natto (Plan B); salmon, lentils, sweet potatoes, oat milk (Plan A).
- **Exclusions**: High-histamine (e.g., aged cheeses, fermented foods except natto), high-oxalate (e.g., almonds, cocoa, apples) foods (**Artifacts 05, 07**).
- **User Preferences**: No apples, cocoa, or meat (e.g., turkey replaced with tofu, avocado, **Artifact 03**).

### 3. Nutrient Timing Compatibility
Foods are selected to support strategic timing for absorption and efficacy:
- **Morning (10 AM)**: Vitamin D3 (sardines, eggs), K2 (natto), magnesium citrate (supplement), protein/leucine (eggs, tofu), flavonoids (kiwi, blackberries) for circadian alignment and muscle support (**Artifact 13**).
- **Afternoon (1 PM, 3 PM)**: Omega-3s (sardines, mackerel), calcium (tofu, kale, chia), magnesium (green peas, pumpkin seeds), B6/B12 (green peas, sardines), flavonoids (kale, blackberries) for inflammation reduction and nerve health (**Artifact 14**).
- **Evening (5 PM, 7 PM)**: Tryptophan (pumpkin seeds, tofu), magnesium glycinate (supplement), B6/B12 (sardines, avocado), omega-3s (mackerel) for sleep (**Artifact 13**).
- **Avoiding Interactions**: Calcium-rich foods (tofu, kale) spaced ~2 hours from magnesium/zinc sources (pumpkin seeds, supplements) (**Artifact 13**).

### 4. Gut Motility Support
Foods are chosen to promote Bristol Type 3–4 stools, addressing poor gut motility:
- **High Soluble Fiber**: ~40 g/day from chia (~5 g/15 g), psyllium (~12 g/15 g) to retain water and soften stools (**Artifact 20**).
- **Low Insoluble Fiber**: Quinoa limited to 50 g/meal (max 2/day) in Plan A (~2.8 g insoluble fiber/50 g); Plan B emphasizes low-insoluble foods (zucchini, green peas, ~1–2 g insoluble/100 g) (**Artifact 20**).
- **Motility Aids**: Lactulose (15–30 ml at 7 PM), magnesium citrate (100–200 mg at 10 AM) (**Artifact 20**).

### 5. Neuropathy and Variability
Foods target neuropathy and ensure dietary variety:
- **Neuropathy**: Omega-3s (sardines, mackerel, salmon), B6/B12 (green peas, sardines, eggs), antioxidants (blackberries, green peas, natto) reduce neuropathic pain (**Artifact 14**).
- **Variability**: Plan A includes ~22 foods (e.g., salmon, lentils, sweet potatoes, strawberries); Plan B includes ~18 foods (e.g., green peas, cabbage, green beans, butternut squash, blackberries, natto) to prevent monotony and enhance nutrient diversity (**Artifacts 23, 25**).

### 6. Dexterity-Friendly and Sensory Appeal
Foods support ease of preparation and sensory preferences:
- **Dexterity-Friendly**: Pre-drained sardines, pre-sliced carrots, steamed vegetables require minimal prep (**Artifact 21**).
- **Sensory Appeal**: Colorful (e.g., blackberries, carrots), creamy (avocado, tofu), crunchy (pumpkin seeds) textures enhance palatability (**Artifact 03**).

### 7. Practicality and Sourcing
Foods are selected for availability and cost-effectiveness:
- **Sourcing**: Available at ASDA, Tesco, Sainsbury’s, or markets; cost: ~$152–$162/week (Plan A), ~$110–$128/week (Plan B) (**Artifact 16**).
- **Substitutions**: Flexible options (e.g., kiwi → strawberries, chia → psyllium, natto → K2 supplement) ensure practicality (**Artifact 25**).

## Food Lists

### Plan A (~22 Foods)
- **Core Foods**: Eggs, sardines, mackerel, salmon, tofu, strawberries, blueberries, kale, spinach, quinoa (50 g/meal max 2/day), rice, lentils, sweet potatoes, avocado, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, oat milk, green tea, flaxseed oil, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, carrots, iodized salt.
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive nutrient profile (e.g., salmon for omega-3s/D3, lentils for magnesium/B6, oat milk for calcium), moderate variety, reduced quinoa for motility (**Articles 4.A–7.A**).

### Plan B (~18 Foods)
- **Core Foods**: Eggs, sardines, mackerel, tofu, kiwi, zucchini, kale, spinach, chia seeds, green tea, turmeric, pumpkin seeds, carrots, avocado, green peas, cabbage, green beans, butternut squash, blackberries, natto, iodized salt.
- **Rationale**: Simplified nutrient delivery (e.g., natto for K2, green peas for B6, blackberries for flavonoids), high soluble/low insoluble fiber, neuropathy focus (**Articles 8.B–10.B**).

## Justification for Adjustments
- **Quinoa Reduction (Plan A)**: Limited to 50 g/meal (max 2/day, ~5.6 g insoluble fiber/day) to reduce bulking, replaced with rice, sweet potatoes, lentils (~1–2 g insoluble/100 g) (**Artifact 20**).
- **High Soluble Fiber (Plan B)**: Chia, psyllium, and low-insoluble foods (zucchini, green peas) ensure ~40 g/day soluble fiber for motility (**Artifact 20**).
