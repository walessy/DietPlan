# Mitochondrial Health

This ADHD-friendly guide explains the role of mitochondrial health in the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan, designed to support MS and ADHD with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient foods. By enhancing mitochondrial function, the plan improves energy, reduces MS fatigue, and supports ADHD focus, complementing nerve health (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**) and neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**).

## Why Mitochondrial Health Matters

- **MS**: Mitochondria produce cellular energy (ATP), critical for nerve repair and muscle function. Impaired mitochondrial function exacerbates MS fatigue and oxidative stress, per **5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**.
- **ADHD**: Mitochondrial efficiency supports cognitive function and dopamine production, improving focus and energy, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Goal**: Optimize mitochondrial function through diet, fasting, and lifestyle to activate pathways like mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant defense, and energy metabolism, supporting the 16 pathways in **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.

## Dietary Support

- **Key Nutrients**:
  - **Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10)**: Found in salmon (100g, ~0.5 mg) and sardines (100g, ~0.6 mg), supports mitochondrial energy production. Included 5 times/week in **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule**.
  - **Magnesium**: Found in pumpkin seeds (30g, ~160 mg) and almonds (15g, ~40 mg, Plan A), aids mitochondrial enzyme function and reduces fatigue. Daily in meal schedules.
  - **Antioxidants**: Blueberries (100g, ~1.4g fiber, soluble) and raspberries (100g, ~3g fiber, soluble) reduce oxidative stress, protecting mitochondria. Included in snacks.
  - **B Vitamins**: Thiamine (B1) from nutritional yeast (10g, ~0.5 mg, Plan A), Marmite (8g, ~0.55 mg), or Vegemite (5g, ~0.43 mg) supports energy metabolism. Plan A targets ~1.5–2.0 mg/day; Plan B uses quinoa/seeds (~1.0–1.5 mg/day).
  - **Potassium**: Found in avocado (100g, ~485 mg, Plan A) and sweet potato (200g, ~694 mg), supports cellular energy balance. Included 3–4 times/week.
  - **Vitamin D**: Found in salmon (100g, ~570 IU) and fortified almond milk (100 ml, ~100 IU, Plan A), enhances mitochondrial efficiency. Daily in Plan A.
  - **For Pregnant/Lactating Women (including teenagers)**: Folate (600 mcg/day pregnant, 500 mcg/day lactating), iron (27–10 mg/day), and calcium (1000–1300 mg/day) support mitochondrial health by aiding energy metabolism and fetal growth. Add 100g lentils (soaked, ~181 mcg folate, ~3.5 mg iron), 100g sardines (~2.9 mg iron, ~383 mg calcium), and 150 ml kefir (~180 mg calcium) daily, per **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle**.
- **Foods to Avoid**: High-sugar foods and processed carbs (e.g., soda, white bread) increase oxidative stress, impairing mitochondria, per **6 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Managing Antinutrients for Optimal Nutrition**.
- **Personalization**: Nutrient needs for mitochondrial health vary (e.g., higher protein for older adults, increased folate/iron/calcium for pregnant teenagers). Adjust portions per **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle**.

## Fasting Support

- **16:8 Fasting (10 AM–6 PM)**: Promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy, clearing damaged mitochondria. Aligns with meal schedules in **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule**.
- **12:12 Option (8 AM–8 PM)**: Used on high-fatigue days (e.g., MS flares), still supports mitochondrial health. Breakfast at 8 AM, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Implementation**: Set phone alarms for 10 AM or 8 AM breakfast. Pregnant/lactating women, especially teenagers, should ensure adequate nutrient intake (e.g., folate, iron, calcium) during eating windows, tracked in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**.

## Lifestyle Support

- **Exercise**: 5–10 min daily low-impact activity (e.g., walking, stretching) enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, per **2 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Exercise Routine**. Pregnant teenagers should use gentle stretches (5–7 min) to support energy without strain.
- **Sleep**: 7–8 hours nightly supports mitochondrial repair, aided by tart cherry juice (100 ml, diluted, Plan A) in snacks, per **7 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Sleep/Recovery**.
- **Implementation**: Log exercise and sleep effects (e.g., “7 hours sleep, more energy”) in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**.

## Integration with the Plan

- **Weekly Meals**: **9 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Meal Schedule**, **11 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Meal Schedule**, **13 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Meal Schedule**, **15 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Meal Schedule** include CoQ10-rich salmon, magnesium-rich pumpkin seeds/almonds, potassium-rich avocado/sweet potato, vitamin D-rich almond milk, and folate/iron/calcium-rich lentils/sardines/kefir to support mitochondrial health, especially for pregnant teenagers.
- **Shopping**: **10 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Shopping List**, **12 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Shopping List**, **14 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Shopping List**, **16 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Shopping List** provide ingredients for Plan A (~$135.93–$141.60) and Plan B (~$84.59–$95.39), including lentils and sardines for folate/iron/calcium.
- **Customization**: Adjust nutrient intake (e.g., +100g lentils for folate in pregnancy, +100g salmon for vitamin D in older adults) using **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template** and **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle**, tracked in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**.
- **Tracking**: Monitor mitochondrial health markers (e.g., energy, fatigue) and nutrients (e.g., “600 mcg folate, pregnant teen, improved energy”) in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**.

## Why It Works

By targeting CoQ10, magnesium, antioxidants, B vitamins, potassium, vitamin D, and folate/iron/calcium, the plan optimizes mitochondrial function, reducing MS fatigue and enhancing ADHD focus. Tailored for sex, age, and life cycle, including pregnant teenagers, it activates mitochondrial biogenesis and energy pathways, complementing the 16 pathways. For guidance, see:
