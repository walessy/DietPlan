# Artifact 7: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Leucine and Protein Timing

## Leucine and Protein Timing

This is **Artifact 7: Leucine and Protein Timing**, detailing protein and leucine distribution for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on mitochondrial health. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients**, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule to balance mTOR activation and autophagy. For menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md).

### Protein and Leucine Timing

1. **Protein Distribution**:
   - **Target**: ~115 g/day (~57.5 g/meal), ensuring ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal to support muscle preservation while promoting autophagy ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/34/6/876/4619018)).
   - **Timing**: Two meals (12 PM, 7:30–8:00 PM) maximize protein synthesis, with fasting supporting mTOR inhibition.

2. **Leucine Sources**:
   - **Eggs**: ~0.5–0.6 g/egg, ~2.0–2.4 g/4 eggs.
   - **Tinned Fish**: ~1.8–2.0 g/100 g.
   - **Turkey**: ~2.0–2.2 g/100 g.
   - **Chicken**: ~2.0–2.3 g/100 g.
   - **Tofu**: ~1.5 g/100 g.
   - **Liver**: ~1.5–1.8 g/50 g.
   - **Total per Meal**: ~2.5–3.5 g, achieved via eggs, fish, tofu, or chicken.

3. **mTOR Management**:
   - Moderate protein (~115 g/day), green tea (EGCG), turmeric (curcumin), and vinegar reduce mTOR activity, supporting mitophagy ([Article11.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact11.md)).

### Notes
- **Fasting**: 16:8 schedule enhances autophagy, critical for MS ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track muscle strength, fatigue via **MySymptoms** ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
