# Artifact 11: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - mTOR and Autophagy

## mTOR and Autophagy

This is **Artifact 11: mTOR and Autophagy**, outlining dietary and lifestyle strategies to reduce **mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)** activity and promote **autophagy** in a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients** (e.g., lectins, phytates), with no strict dietary restrictions, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. Reducing mTOR activity enhances **mitophagy** (mitochondrial recycling), **sirtuin** activation (NAD+-dependent longevity enzymes), and **telomere** maintenance, mitigating MS-related inflammation, fatigue, spasticity, and neurodegeneration. The menu includes **tofu** (genistein), **green tea** (EGCG), **turmeric** (curcumin), **broccoli** (alpha-lipoic acid), and **vinegar** (acetic acid) to support these processes, alongside cofactors (**thiamine**, **riboflavin**, **niacin**, **magnesium**, **iron**, **copper**) for **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**. Shopping is ordered at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, for delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**, totaling ~$128.93–$133.60. For menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for nutritional standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md); for mitochondrial strategies, see **Artifact 13** (./Article13.md).

### Strategies for mTOR Reduction and Autophagy

1. **Moderate Protein Intake**:
   - **Target**: ~115 g/day (~57.5 g/meal), providing ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal to support muscle preservation while minimizing mTOR overstimulation, which can exacerbate MS-related inflammation ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/6/876/4615628)).
   - **Sources**: Eggs (~2.0–2.4 g leucine/4 eggs), tinned fish (~1.8–2.0 g/100 g, 14 meals/week), chicken (~2.0–2.3 g/100 g, 11 meals/week), turkey (~2.0–2.2 g/100 g, 1 meal/week), tofu (~1.5 g/100 g, 7 meals/week), and liver (~1.5–1.8 g/50 g, 1 meal/week) deliver balanced leucine, avoiding excess protein that triggers mTOR ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md)).
   - **Impact**: Moderate protein supports **autophagy** (cellular cleanup) and **mitophagy** (mitochondrial recycling), reducing oxidative stress critical for MS neuroprotection.

2. **Intermittent Fasting**:
   - **Schedule**: 16:8 fasting (8 PM–12 PM) induces autophagy by lowering insulin and mTOR signaling, enhancing mitochondrial efficiency and sirtuin activity ([Cell Metab., 2014](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(14)00183-6)).
   - **Implementation**: Two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within an 8-hour window, with 16-hour fasting, align with circadian rhythms, supporting MS energy and cognitive function ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
   - **Impact**: Fasting promotes NAD+ availability, supporting sirtuins and telomere maintenance, reducing MS-related fatigue.

3. **Flavonoid-Rich Foods**:
   - **Target**: ~249.14–480.78 mg/day, achieved via strawberries (~140–210 mg/100 g, 14 meals/week), blueberries (~32.14–64.28 mg/32.14 g, 3 meals/week), parsley (~10–20 mg/20 g, 14 meals/week), and green tea (~100–200 mg EGCG/100 ml, 14 meals/week) ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
   - **Mechanism**: Flavonoids (e.g., anthocyanins, EGCG) inhibit mTOR via AMPK activation, promote autophagy, and reduce oxidative stress, enhancing mitochondrial function and neuroprotection in MS ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
   - **Impact**: Supports cognitive health, reduces spasticity, and mitigates neurodegeneration.

4. **Polyphenols and Antioxidants**:
   - **Sources**: **Turmeric** (curcumin, ~50–100 mg/5 g, 14 meals/week) and **tofu** (genistein, ~20 mg/100 g, 7 meals/week) activate sirtuins, inhibit mTOR, and promote mitophagy ([Antioxidants, 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/8/671)).
   - **Broccoli** (~0.5 mg alpha-lipoic acid/100 g, 14 meals/week) supports NAD+ synthesis, enhancing mitochondrial redox balance ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
   - **Impact**: Reduces inflammation, supports nerve repair, critical for MS symptom management.

5. **Blood Sugar Stabilization**:
   - **Source**: **Vinegar** (15 ml/meal, acetic acid, 14 meals/week) reduces postprandial glucose spikes, lowering insulin and mTOR signaling ([Diabetes Care, 2004](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/27/1/281)).
   - **Impact**: Enhances autophagy, stabilizes energy, reduces MS-related fatigue, and supports sirtuin activity.

6. **Nutrient Cofactors for Mitochondrial Cycles**:
   - **Thiamine (B1)**: ~1.45 mg/day (nutritional yeast ~0.25 mg/5 g, lentils ~0.2 mg/75 g) supports pyruvate dehydrogenase, aiding ATP production ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)).
   - **Riboflavin (B2)**: ~1.7 mg/day (eggs, milk, fish) and **Niacin (B3)**: ~25 mg NE/day (fish, turkey, lentils) support NAD/NADH and FAD/FADH2 cycles, critical for electron transport ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
   - **Magnesium**: ~388.68 mg/day (seeds, lentils), **Iron**: ~12.66 mg/day (fish, lentils), **Copper**: ~1.3 mg/day (seeds, lentils) act as cofactors in mitochondrial respiration, supporting energy production ([Article1.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact1.md)).
   - **Impact**: Enhances mitochondrial efficiency, reduces fatigue, and supports MS nerve health.

7. **Exercise and Lifestyle**:
   - **Post-Meal Exercise**: 30-minute sessions (12:30 PM, 8:00–8:30 PM) with low-impact movements (band squats, chair push-ups) stimulate AMPK, reducing mTOR and promoting autophagy ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).
   - **Sun Exposure**: 15–30 min/day (~1000–2000 IU vitamin D) supports mitochondrial function and sirtuin activation ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
   - **Impact**: Enhances mitochondrial biogenesis, improves mobility, and reduces spasticity.

### Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Tracking**: Use **MySymptoms** to log **fatigue**, **spasticity**, **cognitive function**, and **constipation** (1–10 scale, aim <2), correlating with **Cronometer** data for protein (~115 g/day), thiamine (~1.5–2.0 mg/day), and flavonoids (~200–500 mg/day) ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Adjustments**:
  - If **fatigue** >2, reduce protein to ~100 g/day (e.g., replace 100 g fish with 50 g tofu in 3 meals/week) or increase green tea to 200 ml/meal for additional EGCG (~100–200 mg/100 ml).
  - If **bloating** >2, reduce lentils to 50 g/meal or strawberries to 75 g/meal to minimize digestive stress.
  - If **vitamin A toxicity** (nausea, headache >2), reduce butternut squash to 25 g/meal or parsley to 5 g/meal to lower intake (~2258.5 µg RAE/day to ~1500–2000 µg).
  - If **thiamine** <1.5 mg/day, increase nutritional yeast to 10 g/meal (~0.5 mg/day boost).
- **Consultation**: Share **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms** data with a dietitian/neurologist after 1–2 weeks to assess mTOR reduction and autophagy benefits ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

### Notes
- **mTOR Balance**: Moderate protein, fasting, and flavonoids balance mTOR to support MS muscle maintenance while promoting autophagy, critical for reducing neuroinflammation ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md)).
- **Mitochondrial Synergy**: Green tea, turmeric, tofu, and broccoli enhance sirtuins and mitophagy, complementing cofactors for NAD/NADH and FAD/FADH2 cycles ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Budget Alignment**: All foods are sourced within ~$128.93–$133.60, ensuring affordability ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **MS-Specific Benefits**: Reduced mTOR activity mitigates fatigue, spasticity, and cognitive decline, while autophagy supports nerve health and cellular repair ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
