# Artifact 3: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Detailed Weekly Menu

## Detailed Weekly Menu

This is **Artifact 3: Detailed Weekly Menu**, providing a comprehensive 7-day menu (June 25–July 1, 2025) for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on mitochondrial health and symptom management. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients** (e.g., lectins, phytates), with no strict dietary restrictions, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. It includes tofu (genistein), green tea (EGCG), turmeric (curcumin), broccoli (lipoic acid), and vinegar (acetic acid) to support NAD/NADH, FAD/FADH2, mitophagy, sirtuins, and reduced mTOR activity. Shopping is ordered at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, for delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**. For standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md); for simplified menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md).
