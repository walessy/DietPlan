# Artifact 5: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Shopping List (Plan B)

## Shopping List

This is **Artifact 5: Shopping List (Plan B)**, detailing ingredients for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **low oxalates**, and **low antinutrients** (e.g., lectins, phytates), delivering ~100 g protein/day (~50 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. The streamlined, low-cost menu incorporates **kiwi fruit** for its vitamin C, fiber, and flavonoids, and **lean ground beef** (480 g, ~68.6 g/meal, 7 meals/week) for its protein, zinc, and niacin, addresses user preferences (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, exclusion of apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no chicken meat to avoid constipation), and uses **dried parsley** (98 g, 7 g/meal) to replace unavailable **Marigold Engevita Nutritional Yeast Flakes**, providing calcium, iron, manganese, and flavonoids. **Marmite** and **Vegemite** are not recommended due to moderate-high histamine risk. Shopping is ordered at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 3, 2025**, for delivery on **Wednesday, June 4, 2025**, totaling ~$81.59–$92.39. For menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for nutritional standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md); for food compatibility, see **Artifact 6** (./Article6.md).
