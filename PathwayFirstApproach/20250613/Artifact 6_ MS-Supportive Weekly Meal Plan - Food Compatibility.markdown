# Artifact 6: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Food Compatibility

## Food Compatibility

This is **Artifact 6: Food Compatibility**, evaluating foods for a 7-day meal plan (June 25â€“July 1, 2025) for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg, ensuring suitability for mitochondrial health and MS symptoms. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients**, with no strict restrictions, supporting digestion, nerve health, and reduced inflammation. For menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md).

### Notes
- **Lower Histamine**: Fresh foods, refrigerated, consumed immediately ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Lower Oxalates**: All foods <10 mg/100g, avoiding high-oxalate options ([The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **Lower Antinutrients**: Soak lentils, tofu, seeds to reduce lectins/phytates ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track bloating, histamine reactions via **MySymptoms** ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
