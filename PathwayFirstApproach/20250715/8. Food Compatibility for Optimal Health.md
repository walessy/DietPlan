# 8. Food Compatibility for Optimal Health

This ADHD-friendly guide evaluates food compatibility for an MS-supportive diet, tailored for MS and ADHD focus, dexterity limitations (no peeling/chopping), and ~25g/day dietary fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble) from whole foods. It emphasizes lower histamine, lower oxalates, and lower antinutrients to support digestion, nerve health, reduced inflammation, and mitochondrial function, aligned with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible for 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM). The table rates foods for a weekly meal plan, with no strict restrictions. Use with Article 5 for preparation methods and Article 6 for pathway activation.

**Why It Matters**: These compatibility ratings maximize nutrient absorption, minimize symptoms (e.g., inflammation, fatigue), and support MS neuroprotection (omega-3s, vitamins) and ADHD focus (routine, magnesium) using pre-prepped, fiber-rich foods (boiling, soaking). Aligns with low-antinutrient diet and fasting for energy.

**Notes**: Lower histamine via fresh, refrigerated foods [](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/). Soak to reduce antinutrients. Track reactions via apps. Low FODMAP portions noted for digestion.
