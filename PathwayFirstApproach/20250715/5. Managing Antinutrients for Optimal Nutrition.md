# 5. Managing Antinutrients for Optimal Nutrition

This ADHD-friendly guide details six antinutrients (phytates, oxalates, lectins, tannins, goitrogens, saponins), their effects, and dexterity-friendly management methods to ensure bioavailability of nutrients like zinc (2.2mg/28g pumpkin seeds), DHA (1.2g/85g mackerel), and magnesium (150mg/28g seeds) per USDA data, while supporting ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble) from whole foods. Designed for MS/ADHD, it aligns with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible for 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM) and uses pre-prepped foods (no peeling/chopping) for low cognitive load.

| **Antinutrient** | **Found In**                                                          | **Impact**                                           | **Management**                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goitrogens**   | Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, 100µg/100g glucosinolates), cabbage | Inhibits iodine uptake, may affect thyroid function. | Boil 7–10 min (~50% reduction, batch prep), pair with frozen broccoli (**green**, fiber ~4.5g, soluble/insoluble) and mackerel (**comfort**, iodine source, fiber 0g), limit raw intake.  |
| **Lectins**      | Nightshades, vegetable skins                                          | May irritate gut if undercooked.                     | Boil (~90% reduction, batch prep), use canned sweet potato (**orange**, fiber ~4g, soluble/insoluble, no skin), avoid tomatoes.                                                           |
| **Oxalates**     | Broccoli (19mg/100g), cauliflower (15mg/100g)                         | Binds calcium, may form kidney stones.               | Boil 7–10 min (30–50% reduction, batch prep), use pre-cut zucchini (**green**, fiber ~3g, insoluble, <5mg/100g), pair with coconut kefir (**creamy**, 100mg/100g calcium, fiber 0g).      |
| **Phytates**     | Nuts (walnuts, 0.6g/100g), seeds (chia, 0.8g/100g)                    | Binds minerals, reduces absorption 20–50%.           | Soak 8h (~50% reduction, batch prep), use white rice (0.2g/100g, fiber ~0.4g), pair with banana (**sweet**, fiber ~3g, soluble, 93mg/120g vitamin C).                                     |
| **Saponins**     | Quinoa (0.2–0.5g/100g), parsnip (0.1g/100g)                           | May disrupt gut lining, reduce nutrient absorption.  | Soak 8h, rinse, boil 15 min (~60% reduction, batch prep), use pre-soaked quinoa (**white**, fiber ~2.8g, soluble/insoluble) or pre-cut parsnip (**white**, fiber ~6g, soluble/insoluble). |
| **Tannins**      | Berries (blueberries, 10mg/100g), tea                                 | Inhibits iron, digestive discomfort.                 | Use pre-washed blueberries (**purple**, fiber ~1.5g, soluble, low tannins), steep tea 2–3 min (~20%–40% reduction), dilute tart cherry juice (1:1, **refreshing**, fiber 0g).             |

**Examples**:

- **Crunchy** soaked pumpkin seeds (20g, fiber ~1g, insoluble) + banana (**sweet**, fiber ~3g, soluble) for low phytates.
- **Green** canned zucchini (300g, fiber ~3g, insoluble) for low oxalates.
- **Orange** canned sweet potato (200g, fiber ~4g, soluble/insoluble) for low lectins.
- **Purple** pre-washed blueberries (100g, fiber ~1.5g, soluble) for low tannins.
- **Green** boiled frozen broccoli (300g, fiber ~4.5g, soluble/insoluble) + mackerel (**comfort**, fiber 0g) for low goitrogens.
- **White** soaked/boiled quinoa (100g, fiber ~2.8g, soluble/insoluble) for low saponins.

**Why It Matters**: These methods maximize nutrient absorption for MS neuroprotection (DHA, zinc), ADHD focus (magnesium), and thyroid/gut health (iodine, fiber) using pre-prepped, fiber-rich foods (boiling, soaking, no peeling/chopping). Pair with Article 6 (Diet Toolkit) for meal planning.
