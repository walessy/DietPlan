# 7. Leucine and Protein Timing for Optimal Health

This ADHD-friendly guide details protein and leucine distribution to balance mTOR activation and autophagy, supporting multiple sclerosis (MS) nerve health, ADHD focus, mitochondrial function, and overall energy. Tailored for dexterity limitations and ~25g/day fiber, it aligns with 16:8 fasting, low antinutrients, lower histamine, and lower oxalates. The plan favors ~1.6 g protein/kg body weight/day (~115 g for ~72 kg adult), distributed across meals within the eating window to optimize muscle preservation and metabolic health. Use with Article 4 for mTOR/autophagy context and Article 6 for meal building.

### Protein and Leucine Timing

1. **Protein Distribution**:
   
   - **Target**: ~1.6 g/kg body weight/day, evenly distributed across meals (~half per main meal) to ensure ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for protein synthesis while promoting autophagy.
   - **Timing**: Meals within 10 AM–6 PM window (e.g., breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner) maximize synthesis; fasting periods inhibit mTOR for cellular cleanup.

2. **Leucine Sources Table** (per USDA data):

| **Food**          | **Leucine Content**                | **Notes**                                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chicken**       | ~2.0–2.3 g/100 g                   | Lean protein source; supports mitochondrial function.         |
| **Cod**           | ~1.8–2.0 g/100 g                   | Omega-3 rich; bake or grill for dexterity ease.               |
| **Eggs**          | ~0.5–0.6 g/egg (~2.0–2.4 g/4 eggs) | High choline/B12; scramble for simple prep.                   |
| **Liver**         | ~1.5–1.8 g/50 g                    | B12/lipoic acid; consume sparingly to avoid vitamin A excess. |
| **Salmon**        | ~1.8–2.0 g/100 g                   | Omega-3s/vitamin D; grill for anti-inflammatory benefits.     |
| **Tempeh**        | ~1.5 g/100 g                       | Plant-based; soak to reduce antinutrients, supports sirtuins. |
| **Tinned Fish**   | ~1.8–2.0 g/100 g                   | Convenient; consume fresh within 24 hours for low histamine.  |
| **Tofu**          | ~1.5 g/100 g                       | Genistein/calcium; soak for low antinutrients.                |
| **Turkey Breast** | ~2.0–2.2 g/100 g                   | High B3/B6; lean for mitochondrial support.                   |

- **Total per Meal**: Aim for ~2.5–3.5 g leucine via combinations (e.g., eggs + tofu), achieved with ~57.5 g protein/meal.
3. **mTOR Management**:
   - Moderate protein intake, plus triggers like green tea (EGCG), turmeric (curcumin), and vinegar reduce mTOR activity, enhancing mitophagy and longevity. Aligns with low-antinutrient prep (soaking, boiling).

**Why It Matters**: Balanced protein/leucine timing optimizes MS neuroprotection (nerve repair, reduced fatigue), ADHD energy (stable blood sugar, dopamine), and mitochondrial health using dexterity-friendly foods. Fasting enhances autophagy; monitor muscle strength/fatigue.

**Notes**: Focus on fresh, refrigerated foods for lower histamine. All sources low oxalates (<10 mg/100g). Track reactions via apps.
