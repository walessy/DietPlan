# 9. Sleep and Recovery for Optimal Health

This ADHD-friendly guide outlines strategies to optimize sleep and recovery, supporting multiple sclerosis (MS) nerve health, ADHD focus, mitochondrial function, and cognitive performance. Tailored for dexterity limitations and ~25g/day dietary fiber, it aligns with 16:8 fasting, low antinutrients, lower histamine, and lower oxalates. Incorporate these into weekly routines for better relaxation, reduced spasticity, and energy. Use with Article 4 for circadian/sirtuins context and Article 6 for food integration.

### Sleep Strategies

1. **Nutrient Support** (from dexterity-friendly foods):

| **Nutrient**   | **Sources**                                                                                                        | **Daily Target** | **Benefits**                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Choline**    | Eggs (**comfort**, pre-boiled or scrambled)                                                                        | ~500–625 mg      | Supports acetylcholine for enhanced sleep and nerve health. |
| **Flavonoids** | Blueberries (**purple**, pre-washed), strawberries (**red**, pre-washed), green tea (**calming**, steeped 2–3 min) | ~249–481 mg      | Boosts cognitive health and relaxation.                     |
| **Magnesium**  | Soaked chia/pumpkin seeds (**crunchy/gel-like**, batch prep), lentils (canned, soaked)                             | ~389 mg          | Reduces spasticity, promotes relaxation and sleep quality.  |

2. **Routine**:
   - **Dim Lights (9:30 PM)**: Reduces melatonin suppression for better circadian alignment.
   - **Meditation (10:00 PM)**: 5 min body scan (e.g., via app) to reduce stress and fatigue.
   - **Cool Room (10:30 PM)**: ~60–67°F enhances sleep quality and recovery.
   - **Fasting Schedule**: 16:8 (last meal by 6 PM) supports sirtuins and autophagy for MS/ADHD benefits.

**Why It Matters**: These strategies maximize recovery using comforting, colorful foods (e.g., **purple** berries, **creamy** kefir) and simple routines, optimizing MS symptom management (reduced inflammation, better nerve repair) and ADHD focus (stable energy, routine).

**Notes**: Track sleep quality/hours via apps. Limit evening water to reduce nocturia. Adjust for fatigue with 12:12 fasting.
