# 12 Diet Plan Summary and Tips

This ADHD-friendly guide summarizes the 4-week diet plan (Articles 01–11) and provides practical tips to implement it, supporting MS/ADHD with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible for 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low antinutrients (phytates, oxalates, lectins, tannins, goitrogens, saponins). Designed for dexterity ease (no peeling/chopping), it ensures neuroprotection, dopamine support, and psychological health (**colorful** plates, **creamy/crunchy** textures, dark chocolate treat on Day 6).

## Diet Plan Summary
- **Goal**: Activate 16 pathways (Article 01) weekly for MS nerve repair (DHA from salmon), ADHD focus (magnesium from seeds), and energy, using fiber-rich whole foods (~25g/day, ~30% soluble from berries/chia, 70% insoluble from vegetables/seeds).
- **Structure** (Articles 04, 06, 08, 10):
  - **Weekly Rotation**: Each week features unique vegetables/proteins for variety:
    - Week 1: Zucchini, broccoli, mackerel, salmon (Article 04).
    - Week 2: Parsnip, Brussels sprouts, tuna, tempeh (Article 06).
    - Week 3: Summer squash, cabbage, sardines, tofu (Article 08).
    - Week 4: Cauliflower, daikon, salmon, tempeh (Article 10).
  - **Daily Meals**: Breakfast (10 AM), Lunch (1 PM), Snack (3 PM), Dinner (5 PM), within 16:8 fasting window (flexible to 12:12).
  - **Prep**: Sunday batch prep (1h 10m) for boiling vegetables, soaking seeds, baking proteins; daily prep (2–5 min, microwave-based).
- **Antinutrients** (Article 02): Minimized via:
  - Soaking (8h, ~50% phytate, ~60% saponin reduction) for chia, quinoa, nuts.
  - Boiling (7–10 min, ~40% oxalate, ~50% goitrogen reduction) for canned/frozen vegetables.
  - Low-tannin foods (e.g., blueberries).
- **Key Foods** (Article 03):
  - **Vegetables**: Canned cauliflower, zucchini, parsnip (~3–6g fiber/300g).
  - **Fruits**: Blueberries, raspberries, bananas (~1.4–3g fiber/100g).
  - **Proteins**: Salmon, sardines, tempeh (DHA, B12).
  - **Seeds**: Soaked chia, pumpkin seeds (~1–5g fiber/15–20g).
  - **Carbs**: White rice, soaked quinoa (~0.4–2.8g fiber/100g).
- **Psychological**: **Colorful** plates (**purple** berries, **green** vegetables), **creamy** kefir, **crunchy** seeds, comfort foods (salmon, eggs), dark chocolate (Day 6).

## Implementation Tips
1. **Set Up Routine (ADHD-Friendly)**:
   - **Alarms**: Set phone reminders for 10 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM meals to build habit.
   - **Labels**: Use clear containers labeled “Day 1 – Lunch” to reduce decision fatigue.
   - **Visual Cues**: Place 1-liter water bottle and colorful plates (**green**, **purple**) in sight.
2. **Simplify Prep (Dexterity Ease)**:
   - **Batch Prep**: Dedicate Sunday 9–10 AM for 1h 10m prep (boil vegetables, soak seeds, bake proteins).
   - **Microwave**: Use microwave for daily reheating (3 min) to avoid chopping or stovetop tasks.
   - **Easy-Open**: Buy pre-washed berries, canned vegetables, and easy-open containers.
3. **Boost Fiber**:
   - **Increase Portions**: Add 100g vegetables (e.g., canned cauliflower, ~1g fiber) if fiber <25g/day.
   - **Flaxseeds**: Consider pre-soaked flaxseeds (15g, ~4g fiber, soluble) for Week 5 (consult Article 02).
   - **Monitor**: Note digestion (e.g., “Regular today”) to adjust gradually.
4. **Manage Antinutrients** (Article 02):
   - **Soaking**: Soak chia/quinoa 8h during batch prep to reduce phytates/saponins.
   - **Boiling**: Boil canned vegetables 7–10 min to lower oxalates/goitrogens.
   - **Pairing**: Combine seeds with bananas (**sweet**, vitamin C) for better mineral absorption.
5. **Fasting Flexibility**:
   - **16:8 Default**: Stick to 10 AM–6 PM eating window for autophagy/AMPK (Article 01).
   - **12:12 Option**: Shift to 8 AM–8 PM on high-fatigue days (e.g., MS flares); adjust meals (8 AM Breakfast, 11 AM Lunch, 3 PM Snack, 7 PM Dinner).
6. **MS/ADHD Support**:
   - **Neuroprotection**: Prioritize salmon (100g, ~1g DHA) 3–4 times/week.
   - **Dopamine**: Include pumpkin seeds (20g, ~150mg magnesium) daily.
   - **Energy**: Keep meals small (2–5 min prep) to manage MS fatigue.
7. **Psychological Engagement**:
   - **Colors**: Use **purple** (berries), **green** (vegetables), **orange** (carrots) plates for visual appeal.
   - **Textures**: Enjoy **creamy** kefir, **crunchy** seeds, **comfort** salmon.
   - **Treat**: Savor dark chocolate (20g, Day 6) for dopamine boost.
8. **Track Progress**:
   - **Log**: Write 1 sentence/day (e.g., “Less fatigue, enjoyed salmon”) to monitor MS/ADHD symptoms.
   - **Adjust**: Increase portions if hungry; consult Articles 05, 07, 09, 11 for alternatives.
9. **Budget Tips**:
   - **Canned/Frozen**: Opt for canned salmon, frozen vegetables for cost savings.
   - **Bulk Buy**: Purchase rice, quinoa, seeds in bulk for Weeks 1–4.
10. **Sustainability**:
    - **Repeat Plan**: Restart Week 1 (Article 04) after Week 4, adjusting for preferences.
    - **Variety**: Swap alternatives (e.g., strawberries for blueberries) to maintain engagement.

**Why It Works**: This plan delivers ~25g/day fiber, activates all pathways, minimizes antinutrients, and supports MS (DHA, fiber), ADHD (routine, dopamine), and dexterity ease with simple, colorful meals. Use Articles 01–11 for detailed guidance.
