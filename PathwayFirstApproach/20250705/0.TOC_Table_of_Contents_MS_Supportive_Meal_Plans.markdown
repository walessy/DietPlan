# Table of Contents for MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plans

This document serves as the table of contents for the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan series, designed for a 54-year-old male with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, supporting ADHD and addressing neuropathy concerns linked to banana consumption. The series includes **Plan A** (~22 foods, ~115 g/day protein), **Plan B** (~18 foods, ~100 g/day protein, cost-effective), **Plan C** (~12 foods, ~100 g/day protein, simplest), and **Plan C2** (temporary, ~12 foods, ~100 g/day protein), covering 4 weeks (July 2–25, 2025). Articles use purchased foods from Morrisons and Tesco, exclude bananas, chicken, bacon, crisps, and lemons, and meet **Plan C**’s nutritional targets with MIND Diet variants. See **Article 1.Overview** for details.
