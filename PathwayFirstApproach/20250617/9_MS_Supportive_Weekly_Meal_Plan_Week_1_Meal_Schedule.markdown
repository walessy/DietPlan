# Week 1 Meal Schedule

This ADHD-friendly guide provides the Week 1 meal schedule for the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan, designed to support MS and ADHD with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient foods. Meals are simple (2–5 min daily prep), dexterity-friendly (no peeling/chopping), and use **colorful** plates and **creamy/crunchy** textures for psychological engagement. The schedule aligns with **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips** and supports nerve health (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), and neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**).

## Week 1 Overview

- **Goal**: Deliver ~115 g protein/day (Plan A, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal), ~100 g/day (Plan B, ~2.0–3.0 g leucine/meal), ~1.5–2.0 mg/day thiamine (Plan A), ~1.0–1.5 mg/day (Plan B), ~25g/day fiber, ~350–400 mg/day magnesium, ~2200–2800 mg/day potassium, and ~600–700 IU/day vitamin D, activating 16 pathways (e.g., autophagy, neuroprotection) with no-chicken proteins.
- **Personalization**: Adjust portions for sex, age, and life cycle. For pregnant and lactating women, including teenagers, increase protein (~125–140 g/day), fiber (~28–29 g/day), folate (600–500 mcg/day), iron (27–10 mg/day), and calcium (1000–1300 mg/day). See **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle** for detailed guidance.
- **Key Foods**: Zucchini, broccoli, sweet potato, asparagus; mackerel, salmon, cod, eggs; blueberries, bananas, avocado, flaxseeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds; white rice, kefir, fortified almond milk, lemon water.
- **Fasting**: 16:8 (10 AM–6 PM) default; 12:12 (8 AM–8 PM) for high-fatigue days, with alarms for meal timing.

## Daily Prep Guide

To ensure food safety and nutrient quality, follow these daily preparation tasks, tailored to fit your fasting schedule (e.g., 16:8 with 10 AM–6 PM eating window):

- **During Fasting Hours (e.g., before 10 AM)**:  
  - **Grains**: Cook 100–150g white rice (Plan A) or quinoa (Plan B) for the day’s meals (10–15 min).  
  - **Vegetables**: Boil 200–300g vegetables (e.g., zucchini, broccoli, sweet potato, asparagus; use canned for Plan B) for 7–10 minutes to reduce antinutrients.  
  - **Seeds/Nuts**: Soak 15g flaxseeds or 30g pumpkin seeds for 8 hours if not pre-soaked (start early morning).  

- **Just Before Eating Window (e.g., 9:30 AM)**:  
  - **Proteins**: Cook fresh fish (e.g., 100g salmon, mackerel, cod; use canned for Plan B) or eggs by baking, sautéing, or boiling (10–15 min).  
  - **Delicate Items (Plan A only)**: Slice 100g avocado and lemon (for 1 tbsp juice) fresh to avoid oxidation (~5 min).  

- **Storage Tips**:  
  - Store all prepped items in airtight containers and refrigerate within 2 hours of cooking.  
  - Label containers with the date (e.g., “Zucchini – June 15”) to track freshness.  

- **Nutrient Preservation and Safety**:  
  - Prepare fish fresh daily (Plan A) or use freshly opened canned fish (Plan B) to avoid reheating risks.  
  - Slice delicate items (avocado, lemon) daily for Plan A; Plan B omits these.  
  - If using canned fish (Plan B), open only when needed to prevent oxidation.  

## Notes
- **Plan B Adjustments**:
  - **Substitutions**: Use canned vegetables (zucchini, broccoli, sweet potato, asparagus), canned fish (salmon, mackerel, cod), and quinoa instead of rice, per **10 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Shopping List**.
  - **Omissions**: Plan B excludes avocado, almonds, fortified almond milk, lemon water, and dark chocolate. Replace almond milk and lemon water with water or green tea; increase kefir or blueberries for snacks.
  - **Cost**: ~$84.59–$95.39, compared to Plan A’s ~$135.93–$141.60.
- **Nutrient Boost**: Increased salmon (5 times/week), pumpkin seeds (30g/day), added almonds (Plan A, 4 times/week), sweet potato (3 times/week), fortified almond milk (Plan A) for magnesium (~350–400 mg/day), potassium (~2200–2800 mg/day), vitamin D (~600–700 IU/day), per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **For Pregnant/Lactating Women (including teenagers)**:
  - Increase protein by adding +50g salmon or +100g tofu to lunches/dinners.
  - Add 100g lentils (soaked, ~181 mcg folate) or 100g broccoli (~63 mcg folate) to lunches for folate.
  - Include 100g sardines (~2.9 mg iron, ~383 mg calcium) 3–4 times/week.
  - Add 150 ml kefir (~180 mg calcium) to snacks or breakfast.
  - Track in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking** (e.g., “600 mcg folate, 27 mg iron, pregnant teen”).
- **Fasting Flexibility**: For 12:12, shift meals to 8 AM (Breakfast), 11 AM (Lunch), 3 PM (Snack), 7 PM (Dinner), maintaining protein/leucine timing (**8 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Leucine/Protein Timing**).
- **Tracking**: Log symptoms (e.g., “Less fatigue today”) and digestion in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking** to adjust portions (e.g., +100g vegetables for fiber).
- **Customization**: Swap berries (e.g., raspberries for blueberries) or thiamine sources (e.g., Marmite/Vegemite for nutritional yeast) using **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template**.

## Why It Works

The Week 1 schedule delivers ~25g/day fiber, high-leucine proteins, thiamine-rich foods, and enhanced magnesium, potassium, and vitamin D, supporting nerve repair (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**), and ADHD focus. With fasting, low-antinutrient prep, and **colorful** meals, it activates all 16 pathways. For guidance, see:
