# Simplified Menu

This ADHD-friendly guide provides a simplified menu for the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan, designed to support MS and ADHD with 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, flexible to 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), ~25g/day fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble), and low-antinutrient foods. The menu ensures nutrient density, dexterity ease, and budget-friendliness, aligning with **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips** and supporting nerve health (**5 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health**), mitochondrial function (**3 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Mitochondrial Health**), and neuromuscular signaling (**19 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Neuromuscular Signaling**).

## Simplified Menu Overview

- **Goal**: Offer a streamlined, cost-effective menu with minimal variety for users preferring simplicity or facing budget constraints, while maintaining ~25g/day fiber, ~100 g/day protein (Plan B), ~1.0–1.5 mg/day thiamine, ~350–400 mg/day magnesium, ~2200–2800 mg/day potassium, and ~600–700 IU/day vitamin D.
- **Personalization**: Adjust the menu for sex, age, and life cycle. For pregnant and lactating women, especially teenagers, increase protein (~125–140 g/day), fiber (~28–29 g/day), folate (600–500 mcg/day), iron (27–10 mg/day), and calcium (1000–1300 mg/day) by incorporating foods like lentils, sardines, and kefir. See **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle** for detailed guidance.
- **Structure**: Repeat a fixed daily menu for 7 days, using canned/frozen options for cost savings (~$84.59–$95.39/week, Plan B). For variety, swap proteins or vegetables weekly.

## Meal Structure

### Daily Menu (Plan B)
- **Breakfast (10 AM)**: Green tea (1 cup, **calming**, FOXO3), banana (120g, **sweet**, ~3g fiber, soluble), lemon water (1 tbsp juice, 250 ml, **refreshing**, rinse mouth). *Prep: 2 min.*
- **Lunch (1 PM)**: Canned zucchini (300g, boiled, **green**, ~3g fiber, insoluble), canned salmon (100g, DHA, ~2.5g leucine, ~570 IU vitamin D), quinoa (100g, soaked, ~2.8g fiber), pumpkin seeds (30g, **crunchy**, ~160 mg magnesium). *Prep: 3 min, microwave.*
- **Snack (3 PM)**: Blueberries (100g, **purple**, ~1.4g fiber, soluble), kefir (150 ml, **creamy**, gut health). *Prep: 2 min.*
- **Dinner (5 PM)**: Canned broccoli (300g, boiled, **green**, ~5g fiber, insoluble), tofu (100g, ~2.0g leucine), flaxseeds (15g, soaked, ~4g fiber, soluble). *Prep: 3 min, microwave.*
- **For Pregnant/Lactating Women (including teenagers)**:
  - **Breakfast**: Add 150 ml kefir (~180 mg calcium).
  - **Lunch**: Replace zucchini with 100g lentils (soaked, ~181 mcg folate, ~3.5 mg iron) and use canned sardines (100g, ~2.9 mg iron, ~383 mg calcium) instead of salmon 3–4 times/week.
  - **Snack**: Add 15g almonds (~40 mg magnesium, Plan A if budget allows).
  - **Dinner**: Add 100g broccoli (~63 mcg folate) or 100g sweet potato (~694 mg potassium) for variety.
  - **Note**: Track folate (600–500 mcg/day), iron (27–10 mg/day), and calcium (1000–1300 mg/day) in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking**.

### Weekly Variations
- **Week 1**: Use zucchini, salmon, broccoli, tofu as above.
- **Week 2**: Swap zucchini for canned parsnip, salmon for canned tuna, broccoli for canned Brussels sprouts.
- **Week 3**: Swap zucchini for canned summer squash, salmon for canned sardines, broccoli for canned green beans.
- **Week 4**: Swap zucchini for canned cauliflower, salmon for canned cod, broccoli for canned radish.
- **Personalization**: Adjust swaps for nutrient needs (e.g., sardines for iron/calcium in pregnancy, lentils for folate).

## Integration with the Plan

- **Budget**: Plan B (~$84.59–$95.39/week) uses canned vegetables/fish, bulk quinoa, and omits lemon water, nutritional yeast/Marmite/Vegemite, almonds, almond milk, and dark chocolate. For pregnancy, add lentils and sardines within budget, or use Plan A (~$135.93–$141.60) for almonds and almond milk, per **10 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 1 Shopping List**, **12 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 2 Shopping List**, **14 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 3 Shopping List**, **16 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Week 4 Shopping List**.
- **Fasting**: Aligns with 16:8 (10 AM–6 PM) or 12:12 (8 AM–8 PM) fasting, per **1 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Diet Plan Summary and Tips**.
- **Antinutrients**: Canned vegetables (boiled 7–10 min) and soaked quinoa minimize oxalates/phytates, per **6 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Managing Antinutrients for Optimal Nutrition**.
- **Tracking**: Log symptoms and nutrients (e.g., “600 mcg folate, pregnant, less fatigue”) in **18 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking** to adjust portions (e.g., +100g lentils for folate).
- **Customization**: Tailor menu for sex, age, life cycle (e.g., +100g sardines for calcium in pregnant teens) using **17 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template** and **20 - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nutritional Needs by Sex, Age, and Life Cycle**.
