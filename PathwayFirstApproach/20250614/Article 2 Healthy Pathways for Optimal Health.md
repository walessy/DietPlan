# Healthy Pathways for Optimal Health

This ADHD-friendly guide defines 16 physiological pathways to support multiple sclerosis (MS), ADHD focus, and overall health, tailored for dexterity limitations (no peeling/chopping) and ~25g/day dietary fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble) from whole foods. Each pathway includes its role and dietary triggers, aligned with a 16:8 fasting protocol (10 AM–6 PM, flexible for 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), low antinutrients (phytates, oxalates, lectins, tannins, goitrogens, saponins), and psychological health (**colorful**, comforting meals).

**Why It Matters**: Activating these pathways weekly optimizes MS nerve health (DHA, fiber), ADHD focus (magnesium, routine), and energy using dexterity-friendly, fiber-rich whole foods (e.g., pre-cut vegetables, berries). Triggers align with a low-antinutrient diet (boiling, soaking) and 16:8 fasting, with 12:12 (8 AM–8 PM) flexibility for fatigue. Use with Article 03 (Diet Toolkit) to build meals.
