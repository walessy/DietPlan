# Table of Contents

This document serves as the table of contents for the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan series, designed for a 54-year-old male with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, also supporting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The series provides idealistic dietary Plans A and B to manage MS symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, neuropathy, bloating, histamine reactions), enhance cognitive health, and align circadian rhythms, tailored to user preferences: eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa/meat, and ~40g/day soluble fiber for Bristol Type 3–4 stools. It includes general information, weekly plans and shopping lists for Plans A and B, monitoring methods, and an appendix for detailed biochemistry. The series consolidates content from **Artifacts 01–28** and **Articles 0–36**, eliminating overlap for clarity and usability.
