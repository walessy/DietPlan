# Introduction to Idealistic Plans A and B

This article introduces Plans A and B of the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan series, designed as idealistic diets for a 54-year-old male with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, also supporting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These evidence-based plans deliver optimal nutrition to manage MS symptoms, enhance cognitive health, and align circadian rhythms, tailored to user preferences: eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa/meat, and ~40g/day soluble fiber for bowel regularity (Bristol Type 3–4). As idealistic frameworks, they serve as baselines, with customizations for the user and general users detailed in **Articles 4.A–7.A** and **8.B–11.B**. Nutritional foundations, food selection, weekly plans, monitoring, and detailed biochemistry are provided in **Articles 2–3, 4.A–7.A, 8.B–11.B, 12–13**.

## Overview
- **Plan A (Comprehensive Ideal)**:
  - **Foods**: ~18 (e.g., eggs, sardines, mackerel, tofu, strawberries, blueberries, kale, spinach, quinoa, avocado, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, rice, oat milk, green tea, flaxseed oil, chia seeds, **03**).
  - **Nutrients**: ~115 g/day protein (~1.6 g/kg, ~28.75 g/meal), ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~300–600 mg/day flavonoids, ~40g/day soluble fiber, ~1800–2040 mg/day calcium, ~4376–6500 mg/day potassium (**03**).
  - **Meals**: Four/day (10 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM) within 16:8 fasting (10 AM–6 PM, **04**).
  - **Budget**: ~$145–$155/week, reducible to ~$120–$130 with bulk/store brands (**17**).
  - **Variants**: Standard (18 foods), simplified (9 foods), MIND diet (increased berries/greens/fish, **Articles 4.A–7.A**).
- **Plan B (Simplified Ideal)**:
  - **Foods**: ~9 (e.g., eggs, sardines, mackerel, tofu, kiwi, zucchini, kale, chia seeds, green tea, turmeric, **22**).
  - **Nutrients**: ~100 g/day protein (~1.4 g/kg, ~25 g/meal), ~10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids, ~40g/day soluble fiber, ~1800–2040 mg/day calcium, ~4376–6500 mg/day potassium (**22**).
  - **Meals**: Four/day within 16:8 fasting (**04**).
  - **Budget**: ~$94–$112/week (~$80–$100 with savings, **17**).
  - **Variants**: Standard (9 foods), simplified (6 foods), MIND diet (**Articles 8.B–11.B**).
- **Timeline**: Start July 2, 2025; order ingredients by June 3, 2025, for delivery by June 4, 2025 (**16**).
- **Standards**: Low-histamine (SIGHI 0–1, <1 mg/100 g), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), low-antinutrient; consume within 24 hours, store at 35–40°F (**07, 11**).

## Purpose
Plans A and B aim to deliver optimal nutrition to:
- **Manage MS Symptoms**: Reduce fatigue, spasticity, cognitive impairment, neuropathy, bloating, and histamine reactions (<2 on 1–10 scale) through high protein, omega-3s (~1.5–3 g/day), flavonoids, and ~40g/day soluble fiber (**03, 22, 20**).
- **Enhance Cognitive Health**: Prevent dementia via MIND diet principles, targeting cognition scores >7 (**28**). See **Article 13** for biochemical mechanisms.
- **Align Circadian Rhythms**: Optimize metabolic cycles (ADP/ATP, NAD/NADH, FAD/FADH2) with 16:8 fasting and structured meal timing (**15**).
- **Promote Bowel Health**: Achieve Bristol Type 3–4 stools with ~40g/day soluble fiber (e.g., chia, psyllium) and ~2500 ml/day hydration (**20**).
- **Ensure Sustainability**: Support long-term adherence through customization, cost optimization, and healthcare collaboration (**17, 20**).

## Reason
- **Evidence-Based**: Integrates MIND diet research for cognitive health (**Nutrients, 2020**) with MS-specific needs (**J Neurol., 2019**) to mitigate symptoms and cognitive decline. See **Article 2** for evidence.
- **User-Centric**: Tailored to MS/ADHD constraints with dexterity-friendly, colorful, creamy/crunchy meals (e.g., avocado, berries); excludes apples/cocoa (neuropathy triggers), meat, and turkey (replaced with avocado, **01, 03**).
- **Idealistic Framework**: Represents optimal nutrition baselines, adaptable via user-specific (e.g., ADHD meal timing) and general customizations (e.g., substitutions for availability, **04, 21**).
- **Practicality**: Plan A offers nutrient diversity, Plan B prioritizes simplicity and affordability (**10, 27**).

## Customization Overview
- **User-Specific Customizations**: Adjustments for your needs, including:
  - Exclusion of turkey (replaced with avocado, **03**).
  - Four meals/day at fixed times (10 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM) for ADHD engagement (**21**).
  - Emphasis on eggs (alertness/sleep), tinned fish (gut health), and ~40g/day soluble fiber (bowel regularity, **01, 20**).
  - Detailed in **Articles 4.A–7.A, 8.B–11.B**.
- **General User Customizations**: Options for others include:
  - Substitutions (e.g., spinach for kale, blueberries for kiwi, **08, 25**).
  - Portion adjustments (e.g., increase sardines for protein, **08, 25**).
  - Preparation tweaks (e.g., steam longer for bloating, **11**).
  - Detailed in **Articles 4.A–7.A, 8.B–11.B**.

## Implementation
- **Shopping**: Source from ASDA (primary), Tesco, Sainsbury’s, or local markets by June 3, 2025 (~$3–$5 delivery, **16**). See **Articles 4.A–7.A, 8.B–11.B** for weekly lists.
- **Preparation**: Batch-prepare 2–4 meals every 1–2 days (e.g., boil eggs, steam zucchini); consume within 24 hours, store at 35–40°F (**11**).
- **Routine**: Four meals/day, 20–30 min walking, lactulose (15–30 ml, 7 PM) for bowel support, 8 hours sleep (10:00 PM–6:00 AM, **04, 15, 20**).
- **Monitoring**: Use **Cronometer** for nutrients (e.g., ~100–115 g/day protein), **MySymptoms** for symptoms (aim <2, cognition >7); consult nutritionist quarterly (e.g., September 30, 2025, **12, 18, 20**). See **Article 12** for details.

## Notes
- **Idealistic Plans**: Serve as optimal baselines, with customizations ensuring practical application (**Articles 4.A–7.A, 8.B–11.B**).
- **Safety**: Excludes incompatible foods (e.g., poultry, cheese, wine, **07**).
- **Usability**: Accessible for MS/ADHD constraints with clear customization paths (**01**).
- **Biochemistry**: Detailed mechanisms (e.g., mTOR signaling, circadian cycles) in **Article 13**.
