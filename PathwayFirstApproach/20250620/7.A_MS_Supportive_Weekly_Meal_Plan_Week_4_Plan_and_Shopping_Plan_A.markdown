# Week 4 Plan and Shopping for Plan A

This article details the Week 4 (July 23–29, 2025) menu, shopping list, and customizations for Plan A of the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan series, designed as an idealistic diet for a 54-year-old male with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, also supporting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Plan A is a comprehensive diet with ~18 foods, delivering ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~300–600 mg/day flavonoids, and ~40g/day soluble fiber to manage MS symptoms, enhance cognitive health, and align circadian rhythms, tailored to user preferences: eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa/meat, and ~40g/day soluble fiber for Bristol Type 3–4 stools. It includes standard, simplified, and MIND diet variants, with user-specific and general customizations. Nutritional foundations, food selection, and other weeks are detailed in **Articles 2–3, 4.A–6.A, 8.B–11.B**; monitoring in **Article 12**; biochemistry in **Article 13**.
