# Week 2 Plan and Shopping for Plan B

This article details the Week 2 (July 9–15, 2025) menu, shopping list, and customizations for Plan B of the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan series, designed for a 54-year-old male with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, also supporting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Plan B is a simplified diet with ~14 foods, delivering ~100 g/day protein, ~10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids, ~40g/day soluble fiber, and key minerals/vitamins to manage MS symptoms, enhance cognitive health, and align circadian rhythms, tailored to user preferences: eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa/meat, and ~40g/day soluble fiber for Bristol Type 3–4 stools. It includes standard, simplified, and MIND diet variants, with user-specific and general customizations. Nutritional foundations, food selection, and other weeks are detailed in **Articles 2–3, 4.A–7.A, 8.B, 10.B–11.B**; monitoring in **Article 12**; biochemistry in **Article 13**.
