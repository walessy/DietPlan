# Week 1 Plan and Shopping for Plan A

This article details the Week 1 (July 2–8, 2025) menu, shopping list, and customizations for Plan A of the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan series, designed for a 54-year-old male with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, also supporting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

It includes standard, simplified, and MIND diet variants, with user-specific and general customizations. Nutritional foundations, food selection, and other weeks are detailed in **Articles 2–3, 5.A–7.A, 8.B–11.B**; monitoring in **Article 12**; biochemistry in **Article 13**.
