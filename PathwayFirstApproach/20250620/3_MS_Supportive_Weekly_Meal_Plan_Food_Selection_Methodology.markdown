# Food Selection Methodology

This article outlines the methodology for selecting foods in Plans A and B of the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan series, designed as an idealistic diet for a 54-year-old male with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, also supporting Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Plans A and B deliver optimal nutrition to manage MS symptoms, enhance cognitive health, and align circadian rhythms, tailored to user preferences: eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa/meat, and ~40g/day soluble fiber for Bristol Type 3–4 stools. The selection process ensures foods meet nutritional requirements, dietary standards, user needs, and practical constraints, addressing potential deficiencies (potassium, magnesium, zinc, iodine, vitamin E, vitamin A, folate, vitamin B6). Nutritional foundations, weekly plans, and monitoring are detailed in **Articles 2, 4.A–7.A, 8.B–11.B, 12–13**.

## Selection Criteria

Foods for Plan A (21 foods, ~115 g/day protein) and Plan B (14 foods, ~100 g/day protein) were chosen based on four key criteria:

### 1. Nutritional Requirements
Foods meet nutrient targets for MS/ADHD management, updated to address deficiencies (**03, 22**):
- **Protein**: ~115 g/day (Plan A, ~28.75 g/meal), ~100 g/day (Plan B, ~25 g/meal) for mTOR signaling (**03, 22**).
  - Examples: Eggs (~12 g/100 g), sardines (~25 g/100 g), tofu (~10 g/100 g).
- **Leucine**: ~9.6–12.0 g/day (~2.4–3.0 g/meal) for mTOR activation (**03, 22**).
  - Examples: Sardines (~1.8 g/100 g), eggs (~1.5–1.8 g/3 eggs), tofu (~0.7 g/100 g).
- **Omega-3s (EPA/DHA)**: ~1.5–3 g/day (~0.375–0.75 g/meal) for neuroinflammation (**14**).
  - Examples: Sardines (~1–2 g/100 g), mackerel (~1–2 g/100 g), flaxseed oil (~2 g ALA/15 ml, Plan A).
- **Flavonoids**: ~300–600 mg/day (Plan A, ~75–150 mg/meal), ~419–839 mg/day (Plan B, ~105–210 mg/meal) for cognition (**22, 28**).
  - Examples: Strawberries (~20 mg/100 g), blueberries (~25–50 mg/100 g), green tea (~100–200 mg/250 ml).
- **Soluble Fiber**: ~40g/day (~10 g/meal) for gut health (**20**).
  - Examples: Chia seeds (~5 g/15 g), psyllium husk (~12 g/15 g).
- **Minerals**:
  - **Calcium**: ~1800–2040 mg/day (RDA: 1000–1200 mg).
  - **Potassium**: ~4376–6500 mg/day (AI: 3400 mg).
  - **Magnesium**: ~420 mg/day (RDA: 420 mg).
  - **Zinc**: ~11 mg/day (RDA: 11 mg).
  - **Iodine**: ~150 µg/day (RDA: 150 µg).
  - **Iron**: ~9–12 mg/day (RDA: 8 mg).
  - **Selenium**: ~55 µg/day (RDA: 55 µg).
- **Vitamins**:
  - **Vitamin D**: ~1000–2000 IU/day (RDA: 600–800 IU).
  - **Vitamin B12**: ~4–6 µg/day (RDA: 2.4 µg).
  - **Vitamin C**: ~90 mg/day (RDA: 90 mg).
  - **Vitamin E**: ~15 mg/day (RDA: 15 mg).
  - **Vitamin A**: ~900 µg RAE/day (RDA: 900 µg RAE).
  - **Folate**: ~400 µg DFE/day (RDA: 400 µg DFE).
  - **Vitamin B6**: ~1.7 mg/day (RDA: 1.7 mg).
- **Rationale**: Foods ensure nutrient density within four meals/day (10 AM–6 PM), addressing MS/ADHD needs and deficiencies (**03, 22**). See **Article 13** for biochemical details.

### 2. Dietary Standards
Foods comply with MS-compatible standards:
- **Low-Histamine (SIGHI 0–1)**: <1 mg/100 g histamine to prevent reactions. Fresh foods (e.g., eggs >2-week expiry), stored at 35–40°F, consumed within 24 hours (**07**).
  - Examples: Eggs, sardines, rinsed blueberries, carrots.
- **Low-Oxalate (<10 mg/100 g)**: Reduces kidney/neurological stress (**07**).
  - Examples: Zucchini (~2 mg/100 g), strawberries (~2 mg/100 g), spinach (~5 mg/100 g, steamed).
- **Low-Antinutrient**: Soaking/steaming (e.g., quinoa overnight, tofu 8–10 min) minimizes phytates/lectins (**07, 11**).
  - Examples: Soaked quinoa, steamed pumpkin seeds.
- **Rationale**: Prevents symptom exacerbation, maximizes bioavailability (**07**). See **Article 13**.

### 3. User Preferences
Foods align with your needs:
- **Functional**:
  - Eggs: Choline (~125 mg/100 g) for alertness/sleep (**03**).
  - Tinned fish: Omega-3s, protein for gut health (**03**).
  - Soluble fiber: ~40g/day (chia, psyllium) for Bristol Type 3–4 stools (**20**).
- **Exclusions**: No apples/cocoa (neuropathy), meat/turkey (replaced with tofu, avocado, **03**).
- **Sensory**: Dexterity-friendly (e.g., pre-sliced carrots), colorful (e.g., strawberries), creamy/crunchy (e.g., avocado, pumpkin seeds, **01**).
- **ADHD**: Fixed meal times (10 AM, 1 PM, 3 PM, 5 PM) for focus (**21**).
- **Rationale**: Ensures medical, sensory, cognitive compatibility (**03, 21**).

### 4. Practical Factors
Foods balance cost, availability, preparation:
- **Cost**:
  - Plan A: ~$147–$157/week, reducible to ~$122–$132 with bulk/store brands (**17**).
  - Plan B: ~$99–$117/week, reducible to ~$85–$103 (**17**).
  - Examples: Carrots (~$0.64/100 g), pumpkin seeds (~$0.76/100 g).
- **Availability**: ASDA (primary), Tesco, Sainsbury’s, markets by June 3, 2025 (**16**).
  - Examples: Tinned sardines, frozen strawberries (winter).
- **Preparation**: Boiling, steaming (e.g., carrots 7–9 min), batch-prep (400 g zucchini, **11**).
- **Rationale**: Ensures affordability, adherence (**16, 17**).

## Food Selection Process
1. **Nutritional Screening**: Identified foods meeting protein (~25–28.75 g/meal), leucine (~2.4–3.0 g/meal), omega-3s (~0.375–0.75 g/meal), flavonoids (~75–210 mg/meal), and micronutrient targets (e.g., zinc ~11 mg/day, **03, 22**).
2. **Dietary Compliance**: Filtered for SIGHI 0–1, low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), low-antinutrient via preparation (**07**).
3. **User Preference Alignment**: Prioritized eggs, tinned fish, excluded apples/cocoa/meat, ensured sensory/ADHD compatibility (**01, 03, 21**).
4. **Practical Evaluation**: Assessed cost (e.g., carrots ~$0.64/100 g), availability (ASDA stock), prep ease (**16, 17**).
5. **Deficiency Mitigation**: Added pumpkin seeds, carrots, spinach, avocado, iodized salt to meet potassium, magnesium, zinc, iodine, vitamin E, vitamin A, folate, B6 (**19**).

## Selected Foods
- **Plan A (21 Core Foods)**: Eggs, sardines, mackerel, tofu, strawberries, blueberries, kale, spinach, quinoa, avocado, zucchini, broccoli, cauliflower, rice, oat milk, green tea, flaxseed oil, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, carrots, iodized salt; substitutes: psyllium husk, raspberries (**05, 08**).
- **Plan B (14 Core Foods)**: Eggs, sardines, mackerel, tofu, kiwi, zucchini, kale, chia seeds, green tea, turmeric, pumpkin seeds, carrots, spinach, avocado, iodized salt; substitutes: strawberries, blueberries, psyllium husk (**23, 25**).
- **Rationale**: Plan A maximizes diversity, Plan B prioritizes simplicity. Additions address deficiencies (**Articles 4.A–7.A, 8.B–11.B**).
