# 01 Healthy Pathways for Optimal Health

This ADHD-friendly guide defines 16 physiological pathways to support multiple sclerosis (MS), ADHD focus, and overall health, tailored for dexterity limitations (no peeling/chopping) and ~25g/day dietary fiber (~30% soluble, 70% insoluble) from whole foods. Each pathway includes its role and dietary triggers, aligned with a 16:8 fasting protocol (10 AM–6 PM, flexible for 12:12 at 8 AM–8 PM), low antinutrients (phytates, oxalates, lectins, tannins, goitrogens, saponins), and psychological health (**colorful**, comforting meals).

| **Pathway**                  | **Role**                                                                 | **Dietary Triggers**                     |

| **AMPK**                     | Enhances fat burning, reduces MS fatigue.                                | 16:8 fasting, green tea (**calming**, fiber 0g), banana (**sweet**, fiber ~3g, soluble). |
| **Sirtuins**                 | Repairs DNA, promotes longevity.                                         | Blueberries (**purple**, fiber ~1.4g, soluble), cod (**comfort**, fiber 0g). |
| **mTOR**                     | Balances growth/repair; inhibition aids cleanup.                         | Low protein (<30g, oyster mushrooms, fiber 0g), salmon (**comfort**, fiber 0g). |
| **Insulin Sensitivity**      | Stabilizes blood sugar, ensures ADHD/MS energy.                          | Pre-cut zucchini (**green**, fiber ~3g, insoluble), mackerel (**comfort**, fiber 0g), soaked quinoa (**white**, fiber ~2.8g, soluble). |
| **Gut Health**               | Supports microbiome, ADHD mood via gut-brain axis.                       | Coconut kefir (**creamy**, fiber 0g), banana (**sweet**, fiber ~3g, soluble), soaked chia (**gel-like**, fiber ~5g, soluble). |
| **Anti-inflammatory/Nrf2**   | Reduces MS inflammation, boosts antioxidants.                            | Frozen broccoli (**green**, fiber ~4.5g, soluble/insoluble), salmon (**comfort**, fiber 0g), green tea (**calming**, fiber 0g). |
| **Hormesis**                 | Mild stressors enhance resilience.                                       | Chili flakes (fiber 0g), frozen broccoli (**green**, fiber ~4.5g, soluble/insoluble). |
| **Mitochondrial Function**   | Improves energy, reduces MS fatigue.                                     | Soaked pumpkin seeds (**crunchy**, fiber ~1g, insoluble), raspberries (**red**, fiber ~3g, soluble). |
| **FOXO3**                    | Supports DNA repair, longevity.                                          | Green tea (**calming**, fiber 0g), 16:8 fasting. |
| **PPARs**                    | Regulates lipids, reduces inflammation.                                  | Olive oil (fiber 0g), rosemary (fiber 0g). |
| **Hedgehog**                 | Supports MS tissue repair.                                               | Oyster mushrooms (fiber 0g).             |
| **Circadian Rhythm**         | Aligns metabolism, improves ADHD focus.                                  | 16:8 fasting, tart cherry juice (**refreshing**, fiber 0g). |
| **Detoxification**           | Enhances liver function, clears toxins.                                  | Frozen broccoli (**green**, fiber ~4.5g, soluble/insoluble), pre-minced garlic (**bold**, fiber 0g). |
| **Neuroprotection**          | Supports MS nerve repair, ADHD dopamine.                                 | Mackerel (**comfort**, fiber 0g), eggs (**comfort**, fiber 0g). |
| **Immune/Hormonal Balance**  | Regulates T-cells, hormones, zinc/D metabolism.                          | Soaked pumpkin seeds (**crunchy**, fiber ~1g, insoluble), coconut kefir (**creamy**, fiber 0g). |

**Why It Matters**: Activating these pathways weekly optimizes MS nerve health (DHA, fiber), ADHD focus (magnesium, routine), and energy using dexterity-friendly, fiber-rich whole foods (e.g., pre-cut vegetables, berries). Triggers align with a low-antinutrient diet (boiling, soaking) and 16:8 fasting, with 12:12 (8 AM–8 PM) flexibility for fatigue. Use with Article 03 (Diet Toolkit) to build meals.
