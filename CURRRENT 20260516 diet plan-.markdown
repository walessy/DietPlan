# Introduction

This cost-optimized 7-day meal plan (Sunday to Saturday, June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 63.5 kg, aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) to support MS management through nutrient-dense foods, delivering ~102g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~51g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 6 PM dinner) within a **16:8 intermittent fasting schedule** (12 PM–8 PM eating window, fasting 8 PM–12 PM, no breakfast). It ensures all 9 essential amino acids (EAAs) and Vitamin B12 (~2.5–3.0 µg/day from food, supplemented to ~1000 µg/day), supporting leaky gut, constipation, bowel-bladder issues, neuropathic pain, post-antibiotic gut issues, and MS needs (nerve health, inflammation reduction). The plan aligns with the video *"Ultimate Protein Guide"* ([https://youtu.be/hHkxBEQaZdY](https://youtu.be/hHkxBEQaZdY)), recommending ~1.2–2.0 g/kg protein (*Am J Clin Nutr.*, 2015), and leverages fasting for inflammation reduction (*Neurosci News*, 2018).

The plan uses **whole chicken** (meat and bones) and **chicken breasts**, frozen upon purchase (Thursday, June 12, 2025) except one whole chicken refrigerated for Sunday, cooked fresh daily with **no reheating** to prevent histamine formation (*SIGHI*, 2023). Bone broth (~2800ml, 14 x 200ml) from ~1400g bones is frozen, defrosted daily, and heated once. It includes ~9 cups/day raw vegetables (~4.5–6 cups cooked, ~600–800g): ~3 cups greens (kale, lettuce, bok choy), ~3 cups sulfur-rich (cabbage, radishes), ~3 cups colorful (carrots, cucumber, white potato, apple), all oxalate-free (<10 mg/100g cooked), lectin-free (peeled where needed), and low-FODMAP, plus olive oil, turmeric, and ginger. Kale is reduced to **350g/week** (~50g/day cooked, ~100g/day, ~1 cup raw/sitting) from 600g (~86g/sitting, 172g/day) to improve palatability, with **butter leaf lettuce** and **bok choy** (100–200g/meal) meeting ~3 cups greens/day (*The Wahls Protocol*, 2020).

**Kale** (curly, Tuscan, or baby, ~£1.54–£2.31, ASDA receipt) provides ~200–400 mg potassium/day (~100–200 mg/sitting), ~1.7–2.0 g fiber/day, ~60–90 µg folate/day, with excess refrigerated (35–40°F, <7 days) or blanched/frozen (0°F). **Plenish Spirulina Detox** (~30ml/day) adds antioxidants (*Front Nutr.*, 2020). **Supplements** include R-ALA (600 mg/day), Benfotiamine (300 mg/day), P5P (80 mg/day), Methylcobalamin (1000 µg/day), 5-MTHF (400 µg/day), L-Citrulline (1000 mg/day), Acetyl-L-Carnitine (1000 mg/day), and Creatine (5g/day), as foods can’t provide therapeutic doses except folate (~223–429 µg/day, supplemented) (*Nutrients*, 2018). The plan provides ~340–390 mg magnesium/day, ~80–100 µg iodine/day (2 seaweed packs), ~25–30 g fiber/day, and ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day, supporting MS (*The Wahls Protocol*, 2020). Some nutrients (calcium, Vitamin D, omega-3s, iodine) are below RDA/AI, requiring monitoring (*Neurology*, 2018). It adheres to low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP, gluten-free, dairy-free, **Healthy Keto/AIP-like** principles, with a budget of ~£56–£59 (~£55.94–£56.71). The journal (Saturday, June 21: cooked 1.6kg chicken, ate ~400g chicken, 30g kale, 2 eggs, 400g sweet potato, 100g butternut squash, 100g cucumber, no olive oil/broth) is reflected, replacing sweet potato with peeled white potato and butternut squash with cabbage.

## Nerve Health Support for MS

This section outlines evidence-based strategies for MS nerve health and myelin repair, based on your research (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUMFDa6knfI&t=751s) and **The Wahls Protocol**, focusing on **myelin basic protein (MBP)** production, **myokine** release, **nitric oxide (NO)** enhancement, and **antioxidant** support (*The Wahls Protocol*, 2020; *J Neuroimmunol.*, 2017; *Nutrients*, 2019).

- **Supplements**:
  - **R-Alpha Lipoic Acid (600 mg/day)**: Antioxidant, myelin repair (*Antioxid Redox Signal.*, 2015). Foods provide <0.5 mg/day; take 300 mg x 2 (lunch, dinner, ~£3.50/week).
  - **Benfotiamine (B1, 300 mg/day)**: Nerve conduction (*J Neurol Sci.*, 2016). Foods ~0.5–0.9 mg/day; take 150 mg x 2 (~£2.10/week).
  - **Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (B6, 80 mg/day)**: Neurotransmitter synthesis (*Nutrients*, 2018). Foods ~2.5–3.7 mg/day; take 40 mg x 2 (~£1.60/week).
  - **Methylcobalamin (B12, 1000 µg/day)**: Myelin synthesis (*Nutrients*, 2018). Foods ~1.7–2.1 µg/day; take 500 µg x 2 (sublingual, ~£1.17/week).
  - **5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (B9, 400 µg/day)**: Methylation (*J Neurol.*, 2019). Foods ~223–429 µg/day, prefer 5-MTHF; take 200 µg x 2 (~£1.40/week).
  - **L-Citrulline (1000 mg/day)**: Boosts NO (*Nitric Oxide*, 2018). Foods ~45–55 mg/day; take 500 mg x 2 (~£0.70/week).
  - **Acetyl-L-Carnitine (1000 mg/day)**: Nerve repair (*Mult Scler.*, 2015). Foods ~9.1–15.1 mg/day; take 500 mg x 2 (~£1.75/week).
  - **Creatine Monohydrate (5g/day)**: Mitochondrial energy (*J Neurol.*, 2018). Foods ~1.51–3.02 g/day; take 5g (lunch, ~£0.35/week).
  - **Safety**: Consult neurologist, monitor side effects (nausea, neuropathy, digestive upset). Store cool, dry (*Nutrients*, 2020).
- **Foods**:
  - **MBP**: Chicken (~150g/meal, ~25g protein/100g), eggs (~12/week, ~6g/egg) provide ~102g/day protein, ~18–22g leucine/day (*J Neurosci.*, 2016).
  - **Myokines**: Leucine-rich chicken/eggs, exercise (20–30 min/day) stimulate IL-6, BDNF (*Front Immunol.*, 2019).
  - **Creatine/Carnosine**: Chicken (~1.5–3g creatine, ~0.3–0.6g carnosine/day), eggs (~0.1–0.2g creatine), supplemented with 5g creatine (*Nutrients*, 2019).
  - **Antioxidants/NO**: Kale, lettuce, bok choy, radishes, cabbage, carrots, cucumber, potato, apple, turmeric (~600–800g cooked, ~9 cups raw/day), spirulina (~5–20 mg PCB/day) reduce oxidative stress, enhance NO (*Antioxidants*, 2020; *Front Nutr.*, 2020).
  - **Limitations**: Foods can’t provide therapeutic doses of R-ALA, B1, B6, B12, L-citrulline, ALCAR, or creatine due to low levels or constraints. Folate sufficient but supplemented (*Nutrients*, 2019).
- **Diets**: Healthy Keto (~70–80% fat, ~35–45g net carbs, ~102g protein), AIP-like (no grains, legumes, dairy, nightshades) support ketosis, inflammation reduction (*Nutrients*, 2019). Carnivore avoided (*J Clin Nutr.*, 2021).
- **Exercise**: 20–30 min/day (resistance, walking, MS-adjusted) boosts NO, myokines (*Physiother Res Int.*, 2024).
- **Monitoring**: Track MS symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, pain), digestive issues, thyroid, kidney function. Consult neurologist for tests (B12, folate, homocysteine, TSH, creatinine) if symptoms arise (*Nutrients*, 2020).

## Nutritional Breakdown (Summary)

- **Protein**: ~102g/day (~182% RDA, 56g), from chicken (~75g/day), eggs (~12–24g/day), broth (~16g/day), spirulina (~0.6–2.8g/day), meets MBP synthesis needs (*J Neurosci.*, 2016).
- **Fat**: ~120–150g/day (~70–80% calories), from olive oil (~392–588g/week), supports ketosis (*Nutrients*, 2019).
- **Carbohydrates**: ~60–80g/day (~35–45g net carbs), from vegetables, low for MS inflammation reduction.
- **Fiber**: ~25–30 g/day (AI: 30g), from kale (~1.7–2.0 g/day), lettuce (~2–4 g/day), bok choy (~2–4 g/day), cabbage, zucchini, carrots, potato, supports constipation (*Nutrients*, 2019).
- **Potassium**: ~3,700–4,300 mg/day (~109–126% AI, 3,400 mg), from kale (~200–400 mg/day), lettuce (~388–776 mg/day), bok choy (~504 mg/day), cabbage (~400–600 mg/day), potato (~1600 mg/Saturday), carrots (~410 mg/day), zucchini (~600 mg/day), cucumber (~150–300 mg/day), safe (*J Am Soc Nephrol.*, 2018).
- **Folate**: ~223–429 µg/day from kale (~60–90 µg), lettuce (~60–100 µg), bok choy (~80–120 µg), cabbage (~60–80 µg), plus 400 µg 5-MTHF, supports methylation (*J Neurol.*, 2019).
- **Magnesium**: ~340–390 mg/day (~81–93% RDA, 420 mg), from kale (~15–25 mg), lettuce (~20–30 mg), bok choy (~30–40 mg), others, monitor (*Nutrients*, 2017).
