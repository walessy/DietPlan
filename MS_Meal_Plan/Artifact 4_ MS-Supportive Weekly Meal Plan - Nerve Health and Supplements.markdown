# Artifact 4: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Nerve Health and Supplements

## Nerve Health and Supplements

This is **Artifact 4: Nerve Health and Supplements**, detailing dietary strategies for nerve health in a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients**, with no strict restrictions, focusing on mitochondrial health to support nerve function, energy, and cognitive health. No supplements are included due to budget constraints, relying on dietary sources for cofactors (e.g., B vitamins, minerals) and flavonoids. For menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md).

### Strategies for Nerve Health

1. **B Vitamins for Mitochondrial Function**:
   - **Thiamine (B1)**: Supports ATP production, sourced from nutritional yeast (~0.25 mg/day), lentils (~0.2 mg/75 g), seeds (~0.3 mg/meal).
   - **Riboflavin (B2)**, **Niacin (B3)**, **Pyridoxine (B6)**: Support NAD/NADH, FAD/FADH2 cycles, sourced from eggs, fish, milk, lentils.
   - **Cobalamin (B12)**: Enhances nerve repair, sourced from eggs (~4 µg/day), fish (~1.29 µg/day).

2. **Minerals for Enzyme Activity**:
   - **Magnesium**, **Iron**, **Copper**: Support electron transport, sourced from seeds (~388.68 mg/day magnesium), fish (~12.66 mg/day iron), lentils (~1.3 mg/day copper).
   - **Zinc**, **Selenium**: Protect mitochondria, sourced from fish (~12.2 mg/day zinc), eggs (~171.01 µg/day selenium).

3. **Flavonoids for Neuroprotection**:
   - Strawberries, green tea, parsley (~249.14–480.78 mg/day) reduce oxidative stress, supporting nerve health and cognition ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

4. **Reduced mTOR Activity**:
   - Protein (~115.5 g/day), green tea (EGCG), turmeric (curcumin), vinegar promote autophagy, reducing inflammation ([Article11.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact11.md)).

### Notes
- **No Supplements**: Dietary sources prioritize B vitamins, minerals, flavonoids due to budget (~$128.93–$133.60) ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track fatigue, spasticity, cognition via **MySymptoms** ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
