# Guide to Using the Customizable Dietary Plan Template

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 10: Guide to Using the Customizable Dietary Plan Template**, providing step-by-step instructions for utilizing the template in **Artifact 9: Customizable Dietary Plan Template** (./Article9.md) to create a personalized 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg. The plan adheres to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and incorporating **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** elements. It delivers ~114.9 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.4 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, targeting ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mTOR activation, enhanced by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements, e.g., bodyweight squats, resistance band rows) after lunch (12:30 PM) and dinner (8:00–8:30 PM) to promote muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and nerve health ([Am J Clin Nutr., 2015](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/101/3/479/4499917)). User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, while chicken may cause hard stools, mitigated with ~30–35 g/day fiber (e.g., zucchini) and 3 L/day water. Apples and cocoa are excluded due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants worsening neuropathy and brain fog. This guide ensures users can adapt the template to their needs while maintaining dietary compliance and AIP principles.

## Steps to Use the Template

### Step 1: Access the Template
- **Locate**: Open **Artifact 9: Customizable Dietary Plan Template** (./Article9.md) in a Markdown reader (e.g., Markdown Reader, https://markdownreader.github.io/) or text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
- **Copy**: Copy the template content (from “### Week: [Insert Week, e.g., June 15–21, 2025]” to “### Notes”) into a new document.
- **Save**: Save as a new Markdown file (e.g., `MyMealPlan_June2025.md`) in the `MS_Meal_Plan` folder, ensuring the `.md` extension.

### Step 2: Define Plan Parameters
- **Week and Dates**: Update the “Week” field with your target dates (e.g., June 22–28, 2025) and “Shopping Day” (e.g., Thursday, June 19, 2025).
- **Weight and Targets**:
  - Confirm weight (71.8 kg).
  - Verify protein target (~114.9 g/day, ~57.4 g/meal) and leucine target (~2.5–3.5 g/meal) ([Article7: Leucine and Fasting Guidance](./Article7.md)).
- **Example**:
  ```
  Week: June 22–28, 2025
  Shopping Day: Thursday, June 19, 2025
  Weight: 71.8 kg | Protein Target: ~114.9 g/day (~57.4 g/meal) | Leucine Target: ~2.5–3.5 g/meal
  ```

### Step 3: Customize Daily Routine
- **Update Routine**:
  - **Wake/Bedtime**: Adjust to your schedule (e.g., Wake: 6:30 AM, Bedtime: 10:30 PM) to ensure ~7–8 hours sleep ([Article8: Deep Sleep Supplementation Guidance](./Article8.md)).
  - **Hydration**: Maintain 3 L/day water, sipped, limited after 6:00 PM to minimize nocturia ([Article2: Daily Routine](./Article2.md)).
  - **Stress Management**: Include 5 min seated yoga (~7:00 AM, e.g., cat-cow stretch) and 5 min mindfulness meditation (~10:00 PM, e.g., Calm app) to reduce stress, per AIP principles ([Article13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration](./Article13.md)).
  - **Exercise**: Retain morning exercise (20–30 min, e.g., 7:30–8:00 AM) and post-meal exercise (12:30 PM, 8:00–8:30 PM, 10 sets compound movements) or adjust sets (e.g., 8 if fatigued) ([Physiother Res Int., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.2087), [Article12: Post-Meal Exercise Routine](./Article12.md)).
  - **Fasting**: Confirm 16:8 (8 PM–12 PM fasting, 12 PM–8 PM eating) or adjust (e.g., 14:10 if fatigued) ([Article7: Leucine and Fasting Guidance](./Article7.md]).
  - **Evening Routine**: Include dim lights, meditation, diaphragmatic breathing, and bathroom visit ~1 hour before bed ([Article2: Daily Routine](./Article2.md]).
- **Example**:
  ```
  Wake: 6:30 AM
  Hydration: 300 ml water upon waking, 3 L/day total, sipped, limited after 6:00 PM
  Stress Management: 5 min seated yoga (7:00 AM, cat-cow stretch); 5 min mindfulness meditation (10:00 PM, Calm app)
  Morning Exercise: 20–30 min, 7:30–8:00 AM, resistance bands, walking, MS-adjusted
  Fasting Window: 8 PM–12 PM (16:8 intermittent fasting)
  Eating Window: 12 PM–8 PM, lunch at 12 PM, dinner at 7:30–8:00 PM
  Post-Meal Exercise: 30 min after lunch (12:30 PM) and dinner (8:00–8:30 PM), 10 sets compound movements, MS-adjusted
  Evening Routine: 9:30–10:00 PM: dim lights, avoid screens; 10:00–10:30 PM: 5 min meditation, 5 min diaphragmatic breathing, bathroom visit
  Bedtime: 10:30 PM, dark, quiet, cool room ~60–67°F
  ```

### Step 4: Populate Shopping List
- **Select Foods**:
  - **Protein**: Choose low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP sources (e.g., eggs, chicken, chicken liver, salmon) to meet ~57.4 g protein/meal, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal ([Article5: Shopping List](./Article5.md)).
  - **Vegetables**: Select ~9–10 cups/day raw (~4.5–6 cups cooked), e.g., kale, zucchini, lettuce, ensuring ~30–35 g fiber/day, avoiding nightshades (e.g., tomatoes, peppers) per AIP principles ([Article3: Menu](./Article3.md], [Article13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration](./Article13.md)).
  - **Fruits**: Include low-oxalate, low-FODMAP options (e.g., blueberries ~50 g/serving, tart cherries ~30 g/serving), monitored for sensitivity ([Article6: Non-Plan Content](./Article6.md]).
  - **Staples**: Include olive oil (~3 tbsp/meal), salt, turmeric, coconut yogurt (~1 tbsp/serving) ([Article5: Shopping List](./Article5.md]).
  - **Supplements**: List magnesium citrate (200–400 mg/day), R-ALA (600 mg/day), etc., for nerve/sleep support ([Article8: Deep Sleep Supplementation Guidance](./Article8.md]).
- **Estimate Budget**: Calculate costs based on local prices (e.g., ASDA, ~£63.62–£65.29 for food/staples, ~£98.74–£102.41 with supplements) ([Article5: Shopping List](./Article5.md]).

  ```

### Step 5: Plan Weekly Menu
- **Customize Meals**:
  - For each day (e.g., Sunday–Saturday), define lunch (12 PM) and dinner (7:30–8:00 PM).
  - Ensure each meal includes:
    - **Protein**: ~57.4 g (e.g., 150 g chicken ~37.5 g, 4 eggs ~24 g).
    - **Leucine**: ~2.5–3.5 g (e.g., chicken ~3.0–3.5 g, liver ~1.5–1.8 g/50 g, eggs ~2.0–2.4 g).
    - **Vegetables**: ~4.5–5 cups raw/serving (e.g., 50 g kale, 100 g zucchini), no nightshades.
    - **Fat**: ~60–75 g/meal (e.g., 3 tbsp olive oil ~42 g).
    - **Functional Foods**: [Insert, e.g., 200 ml bone broth, 1 tbsp coconut yogurt].
    - **Supplements**: Per meal (e.g., 300 mg R-ALA lunch/dinner, 200–400 mg magnesium citrate dinner).
  - Calculate totals: protein, leucine, fiber, potassium ([Article3: Menu](./Article3.md)).
- **Incorporate Observations**: Use eggs (4–5/day) for sleep/alertness, limit chicken if constipation occurs, avoid apples/cocoa/nightshades ([Article6: Non-Plan Content](./Article6.md], [Article13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration](./Article13.md]).
- **Example**:
  ```
  Day 1: Sunday, June 22, 2025
  Lunch (12 PM):
  - Protein: 100 g chicken breast (~25 g protein, ~2.0–2.3 g leucine)
  - Liver: 50 g chicken liver (~12.5 g protein, ~1.5–1.8 g leucine)
  - Eggs: 4 eggs (~24 g protein, ~2.0–2.4 g leucine, ~500 mg choline)
  - Vegetables: 50 g kale, 100 g zucchini, 80 g carrots
  - Fat: 3 tbsp olive oil (~42 g fat)
  - Functional Food: 1 tbsp coconut yogurt
  - Supplements: 300 mg R-ALA, 30 ml spirulina
  - Totals: Protein: ~61.8–63.2 g | Leucine: ~5.5–6.5 g | Fiber: ~4.85–5.0 g | Potassium: ~1,750–2,050 mg
  Dinner (7:30–8:00 PM):
  - Protein: 150 g chicken breast (~37.5 g protein, ~3.0–3.5 g leucine)
  - Eggs: 4 eggs (~24 g protein, ~2.0–2.4 g leucine)
  - Vegetables: 50 g kale, 100 g zucchini, 100 g lettuce
  - Fat: 3 tbsp olive oil
  - Functional Food: 200 ml bone broth
  - Supplements: 300 mg R-ALA, 200–400 mg magnesium citrate
  - Totals: Protein: ~61.5 g | Leucine: ~5.0–5.9 g | Fiber: ~1.85–2.0 g | Potassium: ~1,450–1,750 mg
  ```

### Step 6: Plan Defrosting and Cooking Schedule
- **Define Tasks**:
  - **Pre-Week**: List shopping, storage (e.g., refrigerate one chicken, freeze salmon, liver), and initial defrosting (e.g., 300 g chicken breasts for Day 2).
  - **Daily**: Specify morning cooking (e.g., 150 g chicken, 50 g liver, 4 eggs), evening defrosting (e.g., 100 g salmon for Day 5), and storage (e.g., freeze excess broth) ([Article2: Daily Routine](./Article2.md]).
- **Ensure Compliance**: Cook fresh, consume immediately (no reheating), peel vegetables (e.g., zucchini) to reduce lectins, avoid nightshades ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/), [Article6: Non-Plan Content](./Article6.md], [Article13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration](./Article13.md]).
- **Example**:
  ```
  Day Before Week Starts: Thursday, June 19, 2025
  - Purchase: 2 x 1.45 kg chickens, 100 g chicken liver, 15 eggs, 350 g kale
  - Storage: Refrigerate one chicken for Sunday, freeze second chicken, refrigerate liver for 24 hours
  - Defrost: 300 g chicken breasts for Monday lunch
  Day 1: Sunday, June 22, 2025
  - Morning: Cook refrigerated chicken (1.45 kg, 165°F/74°C)
  - Lunch Prep: 150 g chicken, 4 eggs, 50 g kale
  - Evening Defrost: 300 g breasts for Wednesday lunch
  ```

### Step 7: Implement Tracking and Adjustments
- **Track Symptoms**:
  - Use tools like **Cronometer**, **MySymptoms**, or spreadsheets to log:
    - **Neuropathy**: Tingling post-blueberries/tart cherries.
    - **Constipation**: Stool consistency post-chicken/liver.
    - **Sleep**: Duration/quality post-eggs, liver, or magnesium ([Article8: Deep Sleep Supplementation Guidance](./Article8.md]).
    - **Bloating**: Discomfort post-coconut yogurt.
    - **Fatigue**: Post-exercise energy levels ([Article4: Nerve Health Support](./Article4.md]).
- **Adjustments**:
  - **Neuropathy**: Eliminate blueberries/tart cherries if tingling worsens, ensure no nightshade exposure, consult neurologist ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888)).
  - **Constipation**: Increase zucchini to 150 g/sitting (~1.5 g fiber), reduce chicken to 100 g/meal, liver to 25 g/serving ([Article3: Menu](./Article3.md]).
  - **Sleep**: Increase magnesium citrate to 400 mg if awakenings persist ([Article8: Deep Sleep Supplementation Guidance](./Article8.md]).
  - **Bloating**: If yogurt causes issues, discontinue, substitute bone broth ([Article13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration](./Article13.md]).
  - **Fatigue**: Reduce exercise to 8 sets or adjust fasting to 14:10 ([Article7: Leucine and Fasting Guidance](./Article7.md]).
- **Example**:
  ```
  Track Symptoms:
  - Tools: MySymptoms, Cronometer
  - Metrics: Neuropathy (tingling post-blueberries), constipation (post-chicken/liver), sleep (post-eggs), bloating (post-yogurt)
  Adjustments:
  - Neuropathy: Eliminate blueberries/tart cherries, consult neurologist
  - Constipation: Increase zucchini to 150 g/sitting, reduce chicken to 100 g/meal
  - Sleep: Increase magnesium citrate to 400 mg if poor
  - Bloating: Discontinue yogurt, substitute bone broth
  ```

### Step 8: Finalize and Review
- **Review Plan**:
  - Ensure all sections (Daily Routine, Shopping List, Weekly Menu, Defrosting/Cooking Schedule, Tracking) are complete.
  - Verify compliance with low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP, leaky gut/MS-supportive, and AIP constraints (e.g., no nightshades) ([Article6: Non-Plan Content](./Article6.md], [Article13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration](./Article13.md]).
  - Confirm protein (~114.9 g/day), leucine (~2.5–3.5 g/meal), fiber (~30–35 g/day), and potassium (~3,700–4,300 mg/day) targets ([Article1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards](./Article1.md]).
- **Consult Experts**: Share the plan with a dietitian or neurologist to validate food choices, exercise, and supplements for MS ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Use SuperGrok**: Query for plan refinements (e.g., “Low-histamine substitutes for blueberries in MS diet”) or tracking tips (e.g., “MS symptom logging tools”). Available via **SuperGrok** subscription on grok.com (visit https://x.ai/grok for pricing).

## Notes
- **Accessibility**: The template is designed for easy customization with placeholders to reduce cognitive load for MS users ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **Synergies**: Eggs (~500–625 mg choline), chicken liver (B vitamins), leucine (~2.5–3.5 g/meal), meditation (5 min), and post-meal exercise (10 sets) support nerve health, sleep, and MS management ([Article4: Nerve Health Support](./Article4.md], [Article7: Leucine and Fasting Guidance](./Article7.md]).
- **Avoidances**: Excluding apples, cocoa, and nightshades prevents neuropathy exacerbation ([Article6: Non-Plan Content](./Article6.md], [Article13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration](./Article13.md]).
- **Tools**: Use **Cronometer** for nutrient tracking, **MySymptoms** for symptom logging, and **SuperGrok** for queries to enhance plan accuracy ([Article10: Guide](./Article10.md]).
