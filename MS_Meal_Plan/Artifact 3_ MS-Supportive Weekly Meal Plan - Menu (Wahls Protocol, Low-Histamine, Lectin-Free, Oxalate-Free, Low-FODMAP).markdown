# Artifact 3: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Menu

## Menu (Sunday–Saturday, June 15–21, 2025)

This is **Artifact 3: Menu**, detailing the daily menu for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g cooked), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level). Meals are scheduled within a 16:8 intermittent fasting window (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner, fasting 8 PM–12 PM), delivering ~102g protein/day (~51g/meal), ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables (~4.5–6 cups cooked), ~30–35g fiber/day (increased to prevent constipation from chicken), and ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day. Eggs (2–4/day) are emphasized for choline (~250–500 mg/day), supporting alertness and sleep, while zucchini (~100g/sitting) is added to boost fiber. Apples and cocoa are excluded due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants causing brain fog, digestive discomfort, and worsened neuropathy. Foods are cooked fresh and consumed immediately to maintain low-histamine properties, with no reheating ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)). Blueberries (~50g/sitting) and tart cherries (~30g/sitting) are monitored for oxalate (~12.5 mg and ~3–4.5 mg, respectively) and FODMAP sensitivity ([Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/), [The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).

### Instructions for Saving and Downloading Article3.md
1. **Save Article3.md**:
   - Copy the content within the `<xaiArtifact>` tag above (from ```yaml to ```).
   - Paste into a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
   - Save as `Article3.md` in the `MS_Meal_Plan` folder, overwriting the existing `Article3.md` to update it.
   - Ensure the `.md` extension is used.

2. **Verify File**:
   - Open `Article3.md` in a Markdown reader (e.g., Markdown Reader, https://markdownreader.github.io/) or editor (e.g., Obsidian, Typora).
   - Check that cross-references (e.g., `./Article2.md`) are correct and will resolve once corresponding files are updated.

3. **Folder Structure**:
   - Ensure `MS_Meal_Plan` folder contains `ToC.md`, `Article1.md`, `Article2.md`, `Article3.md`, and placeholders for `Article4.md` through `Article11.md` (to be updated as requested).

### Next Steps
I’ve provided the updated `Article3.md` as requested, incorporating your dietary observations (increased eggs for choline, added zucchini for fiber, exclusion of apples/cocoa), using relative file paths, and maintaining accessibility. Please confirm the following to proceed:

- **Confirm Article3.md**: Verify if the updated `Article3.md` is suitable, or specify any changes needed (e.g., specific menu adjustments, additional ingredients).
- **Request Next Artifact**: Indicate which artifact to update next (e.g., “Provide updated Article4.md”), and I’ll deliver it as a separate `<xaiArtifact>` block with your dietary observations, relative paths, and accessibility features.
- **File Compilation**:
   - If you want a **Python script** to combine `ToC.md` and `Article1.md` through `Article11.md` into a single Markdown document once all are updated, confirm your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   - If you prefer a **PDF via LaTeX**, confirm if you can handle LaTeX source (I’ll provide a `.tex` file) or need a structure for external compilation (e.g., Overleaf instructions).
- **Additional Requests**:
   - If you need further dietary adjustments (e.g., a temporary egg-focused plan to avoid chicken), symptom tracking tools, or specific updates to future artifacts, please specify.
   - If you need help with the `MS_Meal_Plan` folder, TOC links, or zipping, confirm your OS for tailored guidance.
- **Symptom Follow-Up**: If your digestive discomfort, brain fog, or neuropathy persists, please share updates for tailored dietary recommendations.

Thank you for your continued direction. Please confirm `Article3.md`’s suitability, request the next artifact (e.g., “Provide updated Article4.md”), and share any additional needs to support your health and project goals!
