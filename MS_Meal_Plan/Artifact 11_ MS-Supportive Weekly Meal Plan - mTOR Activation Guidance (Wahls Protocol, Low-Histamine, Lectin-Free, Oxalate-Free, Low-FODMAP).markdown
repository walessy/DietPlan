# Artifact 11: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - mTOR Activation Guidance

## mTOR Activation Guidance

This is **Artifact 11: mTOR Activation Guidance**, detailing strategies to activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg. The plan aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and incorporates **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles, delivering \~115 g protein/day (\~1.6 g/kg, \~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (&lt;10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, \~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated with tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), and neuropathy from apples/cocoa (excluded). The menu reduces chicken (\~100 g/meal) and kale (\~25 g/serving), adding tinned fish (100 g/serving, 3 times/week), avocados (30 g/serving, 3 times/week), blueberries (75 g/serving, 3 times/week), tart cherries (45 g/serving, 3 times/week), and pear (50 g/serving, 1 time/week) to support gut health and constipation relief (Article3.md). This artifact ensures \~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal to activate mTOR, supported by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) at 12:30 PM and 8:00–8:30 PM, promoting muscle protein synthesis (MPS), myokine release (e.g., BDNF, IL-6), and nerve health for MS management (Front Immunol., 2019).

### Role of mTOR in MS

- **Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)**: mTOR activation drives MPS, preserving muscle mass, critical for MS patients with mobility challenges, and releases myokines (e.g., BDNF, IL-6) that reduce inflammation and support nerve repair (J Nutr., 2014).
- **Nerve Health**: mTOR regulates neuronal growth and myelin repair, mitigating MS-related neurodegeneration (Front Immunol., 2019).
- **Key Drivers**: Leucine (\~2.5–3.5 g/meal), exercise (post-meal resistance training), and fasting (16:8) synergize to optimize mTOR signaling, balanced to avoid over-activation (Adv Nutr., 2017).

### Leucine-Driven mTOR Activation

#### Leucine Targets

- **Goal**: \~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal (\~5–7 g/day) to trigger mTOR for a 71.8 kg individual, supporting \~115 g protein/day (\~57.5 g/meal) (J Nutr., 2014).
- **Sources** (Article3.md):
  - **Eggs (4–5/meal, \~8–10/day)**: \~0.5–0.6 g leucine/egg, yielding \~2.0–3.0 g leucine/meal, \~500–625 mg choline, supporting sleep and nerve health. Low-histamine (fresh, boiled), lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP (Nutrients, 2018).
  - **Tinned Sardines/Mackerel (100 g/serving, Sunday/Tuesday/Friday lunch)**: \~1.8–2.0 g leucine/100 g, \~1–2 g omega-3s, supports gut motility and nerve health. Moderate histamine (use low-histamine brands, e.g., Wild Planet), lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP (J Neurol., 2019).
  - **Chicken (100 g/meal, \~1100 g/week)**: \~2.0–2.3 g leucine/100 g, reduced to minimize constipation, combined with eggs or tinned fish to achieve \~2.5–3.5 g/meal. Low-histamine (fresh, cooked immediately), lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP (SIGHI, 2023).
  - **Chicken Liver (50 g/serving, Monday/Wednesday lunch)**: \~1.5–1.8 g leucine/50 g, provides B vitamins for nerve repair, per AIP principles. Low-histamine (fresh, cooked immediately), lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP (Nutrients, 2018, Article13.md).
  - **Bone Broth (200 ml/meal, \~2000 ml/week)**: Minimal leucine (\~0.2–0.3 g/200 ml), supports gut health but not primary for mTOR (Article2.md).

#### Strategies

- **Meal Composition**: Combine sources (e.g., 4 eggs \~2.0–2.4 g leucine + 100 g tinned fish \~1.8–2.0 g leucine = \~3.8–4.4 g/meal) to meet \~2.5–3.5 g/meal, ensuring \~57.5 g protein/meal (Article3.md).
- **Timing**: Consume leucine-rich meals at 12 PM and 7:30–8:00 PM, aligning with post-meal exercise (12:30 PM, 8:00–8:30 PM) to maximize MPS, as leucine peaks in plasma \~30–60 minutes post-ingestion (Am J Clin Nutr., 2015).
- **Monitoring**: Use **Cronometer** to track leucine (\~5–7 g/day), protein (\~115 g/day), and exercise response (e.g., squat reps, fatigue) in **MySymptoms** to assess mTOR efficacy (Article10.md).
- **Adjustments**:
  - **Low MPS**: Increase leucine to \~3.5–4.0 g/meal (e.g., 5 eggs, 100 g tinned fish, 50 g liver) if strength plateaus, consult dietitian (Article7.md).
  - **Constipation**: If tinned fish or liver increase discomfort, reduce to 50 g/serving, increase zucchini (\~150 g/serving, \~1.5 g fiber) or pear (\~50 g, \~1.5 g fiber) (Article3.md).
  - **Histamine**: If tinned fish causes flushing, reduce to 50 g/serving or switch to fresh salmon (\~1.8–2.0 g leucine/100 g), monitor with **MySymptoms** (Article6.md).

### Exercise for mTOR Activation

#### Role of Exercise

- **MPS Enhancement**: Resistance exercise post-meal amplifies leucine-driven mTOR signaling, increasing MPS and myokine release (e.g., BDNF) to support nerve health (Physiother Res Int., 2024).
- **MS Benefits**: Compound movements (e.g., squats, push-ups) improve mobility, reduce spasticity, and enhance neuroprotection, tailored for MS physical limitations (Front Immunol., 2019).

#### Protocol

- **Timing**: 30 min post-meal (12:30 PM, 8:00–8:30 PM), aligning with leucine peak (Article2.md).
- **Structure**: 10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements (e.g., 2 sets each: band squats, chair push-ups, seated rows, step-ups, wall sits), 8–12 reps/set, 60–90 sec rest, using resistance bands or body weight to minimize fatigue (Physiother Res Int., 2024).
- **Intensity**: Moderate (RPE 5–6/10), ensuring completion without exhaustion, adjusted for MS symptoms (e.g., reduce to 8 sets if fatigued).
- **Equipment**: Resistance bands, chair, stable surface, accessible for home use (Article12.md).

#### Strategies

- **Warm-Up**: 5 min light stretching (e.g., seated arm circles, leg swings) to prevent injury.
- **Progression**: Increase reps (e.g., 12 to 15) or sets (10 to 12) every 2–3 weeks if strength improves, monitored via **MySymptoms** (Article10.md).
- **Monitoring**: Log exercise completion, reps, fatigue (1–10 scale), and muscle soreness in **MySymptoms** to assess mTOR response and MS tolerance (Article10.md).
- **Adjustments**:
  - **Fatigue**: Reduce to 8 sets or 6–8 reps/set, increase rest to 120 sec, consult physiotherapist (Article12.md).
  - **Spasticity**: Shorten sessions to 20 min, use seated exercises only, monitor with **MySymptoms** (Article6.md.

### Dietary Support for mTOR

- **Fiber (\~30–35 g/day)**: Avocados (\~2.1 g/30 g, Monday/Thursday/Saturday lunch), blueberries (\~1.8 g/75 g, Wednesday/Friday/Saturday), tart cherries (\~0.9 g/45 g, Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday), pear (\~1.5 g/50 g, Saturday dinner), and zucchini (\~1.5 g/150 g/meal) reduce constipation, supporting gut health for mTOR-driven MPS (Nutr Rev., 2021).
- **Omega-3s**: Tinned fish (\~1–2 g/100 g, 3 times/week) reduces inflammation, enhancing mTOR signaling (J Neurol., 2019).
- **Choline (\~500–625 mg/day)**: Eggs (\~125 mg/egg) support nerve health, indirectly aiding mTOR-driven repair (Nutrients, 2018).
- **Flavonoids**: Blueberries and tart cherries provide antioxidants, supporting gut health and reducing inflammation, per **Article13.md** (News-Medical, 2025).
- **AIP Compliance**: Liver (50 g, Monday/Wednesday), yogurt (1 tbsp, Tuesday/Thursday), and nightshade-free meals reduce inflammation, aligning with **Article13.md** (Article13.md).

### Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Track**:
  - **Nutrients**: Use **Cronometer** to log protein (\~115 g/day), leucine (\~5–7 g/day), fiber (\~30–35 g/day), ensuring mTOR targets (Article10.md).
  - **Symptoms**: Use **MySymptoms** to log:
    - **MPS Response**: Muscle strength (e.g., squat reps), fatigue (1–10 scale) post-exercise.
    - **Constipation**: Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Chart) post-tinned fish, avocado, pear.
    - **Sleep**: Quality (1–10 scale) post-eggs, tart cherries.
    - **Neuropathy**: Tingling (1–10 scale) post-blueberries, tart cherries.
    - **Bloating**: Discomfort (1–10 scale) post-avocado, yogurt (Article10.md).
- **Adjust**:
  - **Low MPS**: Increase leucine to \~3.5–4.0 g/meal (e.g., 5 eggs, 100 g tinned fish), add 2 exercise sets if tolerated (Article7.md).
  - **Constipation**: Increase avocado to 50 g/serving, pear to 100 g/serving, or magnesium citrate to 400 mg (Article3.md).
  - **Histamine**: Reduce tinned fish to 50 g/serving or switch to salmon if flushing occurs (Article6.md).
  - **Bloating**: Reduce avocado to 20 g/serving, discontinue yogurt, substitute pear (www.monashfodmap.com, Article13.md).
  - **Neuropathy**: Reduce blueberries to 50 g, tart cherries to 30 g if tingling worsens, consult neurologist (J Neuroimmunol., 2017).
- **Consult**: Share **Cronometer** and **MySymptoms** data with dietitian/physiotherapist after 1–2 weeks to optimize mTOR activation (J Neurol., 2019).
