# Artifact 13: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - AIP Implementation Guidance

## AIP Implementation Guidance

This is **Artifact 13: AIP Implementation Guidance**, providing strategies to implement the **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** for the 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, with weaker digestive motility impacting gut function. The plan adheres to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (&lt;10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and AIP principles. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, \~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated by reducing intake and adding tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), neuropathy from apples/cocoa (excluded), and the use of whole chickens (2 x 1.45 kg) to source bones for bone broth. The menu, based on **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md), delivers \~115 g protein/day (\~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, with \~30–35 g fiber/day, \~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables, and \~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day. This artifact outlines AIP-compliant foods, stress management, and monitoring to reduce inflammation, support digestion, and manage MS symptoms, with shopping ordered online at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, and delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**. For routine, see **Artifact 2** (./Article2.md); for menu, see **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md).

### AIP Overview

- **Purpose**: AIP eliminates inflammatory foods and promotes gut-healing to reduce autoimmune symptoms, critical for MS management by lowering inflammation and supporting nerve health (J Neurol., 2019).
- **Principles**: Excludes nightshades, grains, legumes, dairy (except AIP-compliant yogurt), processed foods, and irritants; includes nutrient-dense foods (e.g., liver, bone broth) and stress management (The Wahls Protocol, 2020).
- **User Context**: Weaker digestion requires AIP-compliant, low-irritant foods (e.g., bone broth, avocados) and stress reduction to support motility and MS symptom relief (Nutr Rev., 2021).

### AIP Implementation Strategies

#### AIP-Compliant Foods

- **Included Foods** (from **Artifact 15**):
  - **Protein**: Eggs (4–5/day, \~500–625 mg choline), tinned sardines/mackerel (100 g, 3 meals/week), chicken (100 g, 11 meals/week, from whole chickens), chicken liver (50 g, Monday lunch). Nutrient-dense, support nerve health (Article6.md).
  - **Vegetables**: Zucchini (200 g/meal, peeled), butter leaf lettuce (100 g/meal). Low-FODMAP, fiber-rich (\~3 g/meal) (Article6.md).
  - **Fruits**: Avocado (30 g, Monday/Thursday/Saturday), blueberries (75 g, Wednesday/Friday/Saturday), pear (50 g, Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday). Low-oxalate (except blueberries), fiber-rich (\~1.5–2.1 g/serving) (Article6.md).
  - **Staples**: Bone broth (200 ml/meal, collagen), coconut yogurt (1 tbsp, Monday/Tuesday, probiotics), olive oil (3 tbsp/meal, healthy fats), ginger (5 g/meal, anti-inflammatory) (Article15.md).
- **Excluded Foods**:
  - Nightshades (e.g., tomatoes, peppers), grains, legumes, dairy (except yogurt), processed foods, apples/cocoa (neuropathy triggers), kale (constipation trigger) (Article6.md).
- **Implementation**:
  - Verify labels for nightshade-free tinned fish, yogurt at ASDA (Article5.md).
  - Cook fresh, consume immediately to maintain low-histamine properties (SIGHI, 2023).
  - Peel zucchini, pear, avocados to remove lectins (Article2.md).
  - Monitor blueberries (\~18.5 mg oxalates/75 g) for neuropathy, use small servings for FODMAP compliance (www.monashfodmap.com).

#### Stress Management

- **Role**: Reduces cortisol, inflammation, and spasticity, supporting AIP’s anti-inflammatory goals and digestion (Mult Scler., 2017).
- **Strategies**:
  - **Yoga**: 5 min daily (7:00 AM, seated cat-cow stretch, 8 reps) to improve motility, reduce stiffness (Article2.md).
  - **Meditation**: 5 min daily (10:00 PM, Calm app body scan) to enhance sleep, lower stress (Article8.md).
  - **Environment**: Dim lights, avoid screens 9:30–10:00 PM; maintain dark, quiet, cool room (\~60–67°F) for bedtime (10:30 PM) (Article8.md).
- **Implementation**:
  - Integrate into daily routine, adjust duration (e.g., 10 min yoga) based on symptoms (Article2.md).
  - Use free Calm app or similar for guided meditation, accessible for MS cognitive needs (Article13.md).

#### Digestive Support

- **Role**: AIP emphasizes gut-healing to reduce leaky gut, critical for MS patients with weaker motility (Nutr Rev., 2021).
- **Strategies**:
  - **Bone Broth**: 200 ml/meal, collagen supports gut barrier (Article15.md).
  - **Coconut Yogurt**: 1 tbsp (Monday/Tuesday), probiotics enhance microbiota (Article6.md).
  - **High-Fiber Foods**: Avocado, pear, zucchini (\~15–17.5 g fiber/meal) promote motility (Article15.md).
  - **Hydration**: 3 L/day water, sipped, limited post-6:00 PM to reduce nocturia (Article2.md).
- **Implementation**:
  - Prepare bone broth from whole chicken bones (simmer 6–8 hours), refrigerate/freeze portions (Article2.md).
  - Monitor yogurt for bloating, substitute with pear if needed (Article6.md).

### Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Track**:
  - **Cronometer**: Log protein (\~115 g/day), fiber (\~30–35 g/day), potassium (\~3,700–4,300 mg/day), choline (\~500–625 mg/day) to ensure AIP compliance (Article10.md).
  - **MySymptoms**: Log:
    - **Inflammation**: Fatigue, spasticity (1–10 scale) post-liver, fasting, target 0–2.
    - **Constipation**: Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Chart, Type 3–4 ideal) post-avocado, pear, bone broth.
    - **Bloating**: Discomfort (1–10 scale) post-yogurt, avocado, target 0–2.
    - **Sleep**: Hours, quality (1–10 scale) post-meditation, eggs, target 7–8 hours, 7–10.
    - **Neuropathy**: Tingling (1–10 scale) post-blueberries, target 0–2 (Article10.md).
- **Adjust**:
  - **Inflammation**: Increase liver to 75 g/serving (once/week), extend meditation to 10 min if fatigue/spasticity &gt;2 (Article15.md).
  - **Constipation**: Increase avocado to 50 g/serving, pear to 100 g/serving, or magnesium citrate to 400 mg if Type 1–2 persists (Article15.md).
  - **Bloating**: Reduce avocado to 20 g/serving, discontinue yogurt, substitute pear if discomfort &gt;2 (www.monashfodmap.com).
  - **Sleep**: Add blueberries (75 g) to Monday/Thursday dinner, increase yoga to 10 min if quality &lt;7 (Article8.md).
  - **Neuropathy**: Reduce blueberries to 50 g (\~12.3 mg oxalates), consult neurologist if tingling &gt;2 (Article6.md).
- **Consult**: Share **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms** data with dietitian/neurologist after 1–2 weeks (J Neurol., 2019).
- **SuperGrok**: Query for AIP optimization (e.g., “AIP-compliant MS foods”) or digestion support (e.g., “AIP strategies for constipation”). Available via **SuperGrok** subscription on grok.com (visit https://x.ai/grok for pricing) (Article10.md).

### Notes

- **Synergies**: AIP-compliant foods (liver, bone broth), stress management (yoga, meditation), and high-fiber intake reduce inflammation, support digestion (Mult Scler., 2017).
- **Digestive Support**: Bone broth, avocados, pear, and yogurt address weaker motility, with minimal chicken (\~1100 g/week) to reduce constipation (Nutr Rev., 2021).
- **Whole Chickens**: Two 1.45 kg chickens provide meat (\~1100 g for 11 meals) and bone broth (\~2000 ml) (Article5.md).
- **Accessibility**: Clear AIP guidance accommodates MS cognitive/physical needs (Mult Scler., 2017).
- **Flavonoids**: Blueberries support gut health, monitored for oxalates (News-Medical, 2025).
