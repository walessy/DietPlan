# Artifact 13: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) Integration

## AIP Integration

This is **Artifact 13: Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) Integration**, outlining the incorporation of AIP elements into the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.7 kg. The plan aligns with **The Wahls Protocol**, delivering ~114.7 g protein/day (~57.4 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints. User observations note eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chicken causing hard stools (mitigated with ~30–35 g/day fiber, e.g., zucchini), and apples/cocoa worsening neuropathy. The plan targets ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mTOR activation, supported by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) at 12:30 PM and 8:00–8:30 PM ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)). This artifact introduces AIP components to reduce inflammation, enhance gut health, and support MS symptom management, with implementation steps and tracking guidance. For plan overview, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for menu, see **Artifact 3** (./Article3.md); for routine, see **Artifact 2** (./Article2.md); for food compatibility, see **Artifact 6** (./Article6.md).

### AIP Components Introduced

#### 1. Organ Meats (Chicken Liver)
- **Purpose**: Boost B vitamins (B12, folate), iron, and leucine (~3.0–3.5 g/100 g) for nerve repair and mTOR activation ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)).
- **Implementation**:
  - Add 50 g fresh chicken liver to Monday lunch and Wednesday dinner, replacing 50 g chicken ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
  - Purchase 100 g/week (~£1.50, ASDA Fresh Meat Aisle), cook fresh (sauté, 165°F/74°C), freeze excess ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
  - Monitor constipation/neuropathy with **MySymptoms**, increase to 100 g/serving if tolerated ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md]).
- **Compatibility**: Low-histamine (fresh), lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP, leaky gut/MS-supportive.
- **Synergy**: Enhances egg-related sleep benefits, reduces chicken reliance, supports 12:30 PM exercise ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

#### 2. Low-Histamine Fermented Foods (Coconut Yogurt)
- **Purpose**: Promote microbiome diversity, reduce leaky gut ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Implementation**:
  - Add 1 tbsp coconut yogurt to Tuesday lunch and Thursday dinner ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
  - Purchase 100 ml/week (~£0.50, ASDA International Aisle), refrigerate, consume within 48 hours ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
  - Monitor bloating with **Cronometer**, increase to 2 tbsp if no issues ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
- **Compatibility**: Low-histamine (fresh), lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP (small servings), leaky gut/MS-supportive.
- **Synergy**: Reduces chicken constipation, supports egg benefits, enhances exercise efficacy ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

#### 3. Nightshade Elimination
- **Purpose**: Reduce inflammation from alkaloids ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888)).
- **Implementation**:
  - Maintain nightshade exclusion, check staples for additives (e.g., paprika) ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
  - Track neuropathy with **MySymptoms** ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
- **Compatibility**: Fully compliant with existing plan.
- **Synergy**: Prevents neuropathy, supports egg/exercise benefits ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

#### 4. Stress Management (Meditation and Yoga)
- **Purpose**: Reduce stress to improve sleep and immune balance ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **Implementation**:
  - Add 5 min meditation (~10:00 PM, Calm app) and 5 min seated yoga (~7:00 AM, cat-cow stretch) to daily routine ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
  - Track stress/sleep with **MySymptoms**, adjust to 3 min if overwhelming ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
- **Compatibility**: Enhances fasting/exercise routine, no dietary impact.
- **Synergy**: Boosts egg-related sleep, supports 12:30 PM exercise ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

### Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Track**:
  - Use **Cronometer** for nutrients (e.g., B12 from liver, fiber from zucchini).
  - Log symptoms (constipation, neuropathy, sleep, stress) in **MySymptoms** ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Adjust**:
  - **Liver**: Increase to 100 g/serving if no digestive issues, discontinue if histamine sensitivity.
  - **Yogurt**: Increase to 2 tbsp/day if no bloating, replace with bone broth if intolerant.
  - **Meditation/Yoga**: Shorten to 3 min or switch to muscle relaxation if fatiguing.
- **Consult**: Share logs with dietitian/physiotherapist after 1–2 weeks ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
