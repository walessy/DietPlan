# Artifact 13: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) Integration

## AIP Integration

This is **Artifact 13: Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) Integration**, outlining the incorporation of AIP elements into the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg. The plan aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level), delivering ~115 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, with relaxed restrictions to address chronic constipation. User observations note eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chicken and kale causing constipation (mitigated with fiber, e.g., avocados), and tinned fish/avocados improving gut health despite histamine risks. Apples and cocoa are excluded due to neuropathy exacerbation. The plan targets ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mTOR activation, supported by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) at 12:30 PM and 8:00–8:30 PM ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)). This artifact integrates AIP components (chicken liver, coconut yogurt, nightshade elimination, stress management) and adds tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods (e.g., blueberries, tart cherries) to reduce inflammation, enhance gut health, and manage MS symptoms, inspired by flavonoid benefits for gut hormones ([News-Medical, 2025](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250326/Flavonoids-help-regulate-gut-hormones-and-show-promise-in-managing-type-2-diabetes.aspx)).

  - Retain 5 min mindfulness meditation (~10:00 PM, e.g., Calm app body scan) and 5 min seated yoga (~7:00 AM, e.g., cat-cow stretch: sit, inhale to arch back, exhale to round spine, 8 reps) in daily routine ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
  - Track stress (1–10 scale) and sleep with **MySymptoms**, noting egg/tinned fish synergy ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
  - Shorten to 3 min meditation or 4 yoga reps if fatiguing ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
- **Compatibility**: Enhances fasting/exercise routine, no dietary impact.
- **Synergy**: Boosts sleep, supports 12:30 PM exercise, reduces spasticity ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

### Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Track**:
  - Use **Cronometer** for nutrients (e.g., omega-3s from tinned fish, fiber from avocados, flavonoids from berries).
  - Log symptoms in **MySymptoms**: constipation (post-fish/avocado), neuropathy (post-berries), bloating (post-yogurt/fish), sleep (post-eggs) ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Adjust**:
  - **Tinned Fish**: Reduce to 50 g/serving if histamine symptoms (e.g., flushing), switch to fresh salmon if intolerant ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
  - **Avocados**: Increase to 50 g/serving if no bloating, discontinue if FODMAP issues ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
  - **Berries**: Reduce blueberries to 50 g, cherries to 30 g if oxalate sensitivity, monitor neuropathy ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
  - **Liver/Yogurt**: Adjust as above if digestive issues persist.
  - **Constipation**: If unresolved, increase avocado to 50 g/serving, add 50 g peeled pear (low-oxalate, low-FODMAP) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Consult**: Share logs with dietitian/neurologist after 1–2 weeks to assess fish/avocado/berry tolerance and constipation relief ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

### Notes
- **Budget Impact**: Adds ~£8.65/week (~£1.50 liver, ~£0.50 yogurt, ~£4.50 tinned fish, ~£2.10 avocados, ~£0.55 extra berries), adjusting food/staples budget to ~£70.27–£71.94, total ~£105.39–£109.06 with supplements ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **Integration**: Updates to **Article2.md** (routine), **Article3.md** (menu), **Article5.md** (shopping), and **Article6.md** (food rationale) reflect tinned fish, avocados, and increased berries.
- **Accessibility**: Clear steps and tracking tools accommodate MS cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **Flavonoid Caution**: Monitor berries for oxalate/FODMAP limits to prevent neuropathy, aligning with MS constraints ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
