# Artifact 13: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) Integration

## AIP Integration

This is **Artifact 13: Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) Integration**, outlining the incorporation of AIP elements into the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg. The plan aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level), delivering ~115 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints. User observations note eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chicken causing hard stools (mitigated with ~30–35 g/day fiber, e.g., zucchini), and apples/cocoa worsening neuropathy. The plan targets ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mTOR activation, supported by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) at 12:30 PM and 8:00–8:30 PM ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)). This artifact introduces AIP components (chicken liver, coconut yogurt, nightshade elimination, stress management) to reduce inflammation, enhance gut health, and support MS symptom management, with implementation steps and tracking guidance. For plan overview, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for menu, see **Artifact 3** (./Article3.md); for routine, see **Artifact 2** (./Article2.md); for food compatibility, see **Artifact 6** (./Article6.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for exercise, see **Artifact 12** (./Article12.md).

### AIP Components Introduced

#### 1. Organ Meats (Chicken Liver)
- **Purpose**: Boost B vitamins (B12, folate), iron, and leucine (~3.0–3.5 g/100 g) for nerve repair and mTOR activation ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)).
- **Implementation**:
  - Add 50 g fresh chicken liver to Monday lunch and Wednesday dinner, replacing 50 g chicken ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
  - Purchase 100 g/week (~£1.50, ASDA Fresh Meat Aisle), cook fresh (sauté, 165°F/74°C), freeze excess in 50 g portions ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
  - Monitor constipation/neuropathy with **MySymptoms**, increase to 100 g/serving if tolerated ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
- **Compatibility**: Low-histamine (fresh, consumed within 24 hours), lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP (small servings), leaky gut/MS-supportive ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Synergy**: Enhances egg-related sleep benefits, reduces chicken reliance (less constipation risk), supports 12:30 PM exercise for mTOR activation ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

#### 2. Low-Histamine Fermented Foods (Coconut Yogurt)
- **Purpose**: Promote microbiome diversity, reduce leaky gut, support immune regulation ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Implementation**:
  - Add 1 tbsp coconut yogurt (~£0.50, ASDA International Aisle) to Tuesday lunch and Thursday dinner ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
  - Purchase 100 ml/week, refrigerate at 35–40°F, consume within 48 hours, check for no additives ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
  - Monitor bloating with **Cronometer**, increase to 2 tbsp if no issues, discontinue if histamine sensitivity arises ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
- **Compatibility**: Low-histamine (fresh, consumed within 48 hours), lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP (small servings), leaky gut/MS-supportive ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Synergy**: Reduces chicken-related constipation, supports egg benefits, enhances exercise efficacy ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

#### 3. Nightshade Elimination
- **Purpose**: Reduce inflammation from alkaloids (e.g., solanine), potentially worsening MS neuropathy ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888)).
- **Implementation**:
  - Maintain nightshade exclusion (e.g., no tomatoes, peppers, eggplants) in meals, shopping, and substitutions ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
  - Check labels for nightshade-based additives (e.g., paprika in spices) ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
  - Track neuropathy with **MySymptoms** to confirm benefits ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
  - If sourcing new foods, query **SuperGrok**: “Nightshade-free, low-histamine vegetables for MS” (grok.com, subscription required) ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Compatibility**: Fully compliant with existing plan, enhances leaky gut/MS-supportive goals.
- **Synergy**: Prevents neuropathy, supports egg/exercise benefits ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

#### 4. Stress Management (Meditation and Yoga)
- **Purpose**: Reduce stress to improve sleep, immune balance, and MS symptom management ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **Implementation**:
  - Add 5 min mindfulness meditation (~10:00 PM, e.g., guided body scan via Calm app) and 5 min seated yoga (~7:00 AM, e.g., cat-cow stretch: sit, inhale to arch back, exhale to round spine, 8 reps) to daily routine ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
  - Track stress (1–10 scale) and sleep quality with **MySymptoms**, noting egg/liver synergy ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
  - If meditation feels overwhelming, shorten to 3 min or try progressive muscle relaxation. If yoga causes fatigue, reduce reps to 4 ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
- **Compatibility**: Enhances fasting/exercise routine, no dietary impact, aligns with AIP’s holistic approach.
- **Synergy**: Boosts egg-related sleep, supports 12:30 PM exercise, reduces spasticity ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

### Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Track**:
  - Use **Cronometer** for nutrients (e.g., B12 from liver, fiber from zucchini).
  - Log symptoms (constipation, neuropathy, sleep, stress) in **MySymptoms** ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Adjust**:
  - **Liver**: Increase to 100 g/serving if no digestive issues, discontinue if histamine sensitivity.
  - **Yogurt**: Increase to 2 tbsp/day if no bloating, replace with bone broth if intolerant.
  - **Meditation/Yoga**: Shorten to 3 min or switch to muscle relaxation if fatiguing.
  - **Neuropathy**: If tingling persists, confirm nightshade exclusion, reduce blueberries/tart cherries ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
- **Consult**: Share logs with dietitian/physiotherapist after 1–2 weeks to assess liver/yogurt tolerance and yoga benefits ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

### Notes
- **Budget Impact**: Adds ~£2.00/week (~£1.50 liver, ~£0.50 yogurt), adjusting food/staples budget to ~£63.62–£65.29, total ~£98.74–£102.41 with supplements ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **Integration**: Updates to **Article2.md** (routine), **Article3.md** (menu), **Article5.md** (shopping), and **Article6.md** (food rationale) ensure seamless AIP adoption.
- **Accessibility**: Simple steps and tracking tools (e.g., **MySymptoms**) accommodate MS-related cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
