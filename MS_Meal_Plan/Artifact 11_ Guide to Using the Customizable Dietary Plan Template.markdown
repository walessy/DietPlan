# Artifact 11: Guide to Using the Customizable Dietary Plan Template

## Guide to Using the Template

This is **Artifact 11: Guide to Using the Customizable Dietary Plan Template**, providing step-by-step instructions on how to use **Artifact 10: Customizable Dietary Plan Template** (./Article10.md) to create a personalized dietary plan adhering to user-defined [DIETARY_CONSTRAINTS, e.g., Low-Histamine, Oxalate-Free] guidelines. Designed for users with [HEALTH_CONDITIONS, e.g., MS, IBS], this guide explains how to leverage the template’s structure, **keywords**, and **ingredient evaluation methodology** to tailor a plan for [PLAN_DURATION, e.g., 7 days] with [BUDGET, e.g., £60–£80]. User observations highlight eggs (2–4/day, ~250–500 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chicken causing constipation (mitigated by fiber, e.g., zucchini), and apples/cocoa triggering brain fog and neuropathy due to oxalates and stimulants. The template supports dietary needs, nutrient tracking, and preferences, ensuring accessibility for users with cognitive or health-related needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)). For the template, see **Artifact 10: Customizable Dietary Plan Template** (./Article10.md); for nutritional standards, see **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards** (./Article1.md); for menu examples, see **Artifact 3: Menu** (./Article3.md); for sources, see **Artifact 6: References** (./Article6.md).

### Step 1: Understand the Template Structure
The template (`Article10.md`) is organized into sections mirroring a comprehensive meal plan, each customizable using **keywords**:
- **Introduction**: Defines the plan’s purpose, user profile, and dietary constraints.
- **Nutritional Standards**: Specifies nutrient targets (e.g., protein, choline) and tracking methods.
- **Daily Routine**: Outlines fasting, exercise, meal timing, and preparation schedules.
- **Menu**: Details daily meals with ingredients, nutrients, and preparation notes.
- **Health Strategies**: Describes health-focused approaches (e.g., nerve health, sleep support).
- **Shopping List**: Lists ingredients, quantities, costs, and sourcing.
- **References**: Cites sources for credibility.
- **Food Evaluation**: Evaluates food compatibility and constraints.
- **Supplemental Notes**: Provides additional guidance (e.g., supplementation, monitoring).

**Action**: Review `Article10.md` to familiarize yourself with sections and placeholders (e.g., [USER_PROFILE]). Use a Markdown reader like Markdown Reader (https://markdownreader.github.io/) for clear viewing ([Physiother Res Int., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.2087)).

### Step 2: Define Your User Profile and Goals
Start by customizing the **Introduction** section to reflect your needs:
- **User Profile**: Specify [AGE, WEIGHT, GENDER, HEIGHT, ACTIVITY_LEVEL, e.g., 54-year-old male, 63.5 kg, sedentary].
- **Health Conditions**: Identify [HEALTH_CONDITIONS, e.g., MS, neuropathy].
- **Dietary Constraints**: Choose [CONSTRAINTS, e.g., Low-Histamine, Oxalate-Free, Low-FODMAP].
- **Goals**: Define [GOALS, e.g., nerve health, digestive comfort, improved sleep].
- **Preferences**: Set [BUDGET, MEAL_FREQUENCY, PLAN_DURATION, e.g., £60/week, 2 meals/day, 7 days].

**Example**:
```markdown
This is **Artifact 10: Customizable Dietary Plan Template**, a plan for a [54-year-old male, 63.5 kg, MS] with [neuropathy] adhering to [Low-Histamine, Oxalate-Free, Low-FODMAP] guidelines. The [7-day] plan has a [budget of £60] and aims to [improve nerve health and sleep].
```

**Keywords**: User Profile, Health Conditions, Dietary Constraints (Low-Histamine, Oxalate-Free, Low-FODMAP, etc.), Goals, Budget, Meal Frequency, Custom Preference

### Step 3: Set Nutritional Standards
In the **Nutritional Standards** section, define nutrient targets and tracking methods:
- **Select Nutrients**: Choose [NUTRIENTS, e.g., Protein, Choline, Magnesium, Fiber] based on goals. Eggs (~250–500 mg choline/day, 2–4/day) are key for MS nerve health and sleep ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)).
- **Set Targets**: Specify [AMOUNTS, e.g., 102g protein/day, 250–500 mg choline/day], referencing [RDA, AI, UL] from sources like USDA FoodData Central ([Artifact 6: References](./Article6.md)). Ensure fiber (~30–35g/day) to prevent constipation from high-protein foods like chicken.
- **Tracking Method**: Use [METHOD, e.g., sum per-meal nutrients, compare to RDA/AI/UL, adjust for bioavailability]. Tools like Cronometer or spreadsheets can help.

**Example**:
```markdown
- **Nutrient Targets**:
  - Protein: [102g/day, 182% RDA]
  - Choline: [250–500 mg/day, 45–91% AI]
  - Magnesium: [540–790 mg/day, 129–188% RDA]
  - Fiber: [30–35g/day, 100–117% AI]
- **Daily Total Tracker**: [Sum per-meal nutrients using USDA FoodData Central, track in spreadsheet]
```

**Keywords**: Nutrients (Protein, Choline, Fiber, Magnesium, etc.), Daily Total, RDA, AI, UL, Bioavailability, Stool Consistency, Custom Nutrient

### Step 4: Plan Your Daily Routine
Customize the **Daily Routine** section to align with your lifestyle:
- **Morning Ritual**: Define [ACTIVITIES, e.g., wake at 7:00 AM, 300ml water, 20 min resistance bands].
- **Fasting Schedule**: Choose [TYPE, e.g., 16:8, 12 PM–8 PM eating window, no fasting].
- **Exercise**: Specify [TYPE, DURATION, e.g., 20 min walking, 7:30 AM, MS-adjusted].
- **Eating Window**: Set [TIMES, e.g., Lunch 12 PM, Dinner 7:30 PM].
- **Evening Routine**: Include [ACTIVITIES, e.g., dim lights 10:00 PM, bedtime 11:00 PM].
- **Defrosting/Cooking**: Plan [SCHEDULE, e.g., defrost 150g salmon 24 hours prior, cook fresh].

**Example**:
```markdown
- **Morning Ritual**: [Wake at 7:00 AM, 300ml water, 20 min walking]
- **Fasting Schedule**: [16:8, 12 PM–8 PM eating window]
- **Eating Window**: [Lunch 12 PM, Dinner 7:30 PM]
- **Defrosting/Cooking**: [Cook 2 eggs, 100g zucchini fresh for lunch]
```

**Keywords**: Morning Ritual, Fasting (16:8), Exercise (Cardio, Strength Training), Eating Window, Evening Routine, Preparation (Fresh Cooking), Digestive Comfort, Custom Activity

### Step 5: Create Your Menu
In the **Menu** section, design daily meals with nutrient breakdowns:
- **Meals**: Define [MEALS, e.g., Lunch, Dinner] for each [DAY, e.g., Monday].
- **Ingredients**: List [ITEMS, e.g., 2 eggs, 100g zucchini, 3 tbsp olive oil], ensuring compliance with [CONSTRAINTS, e.g., Low-Histamine]. Avoid chicken if constipation is a concern, favoring eggs.
- **Nutrients**: Calculate [AMOUNTS, e.g., 12g protein, 250 mg choline] using [SOURCE, e.g., USDA FoodData Central].
- **Preparation**: Specify [METHOD, e.g., boil eggs, steam zucchini].
- **Supplements**: Include [ITEMS, e.g., 200 mg magnesium citrate].
- **Daily Total**: Sum [NUTRIENTS, e.g., 102g protein, 3700 mg potassium].

**Example**:
```markdown
- **Monday**:
  - **Lunch (12 PM)**:
    - Ingredients: [2 eggs, 100g zucchini, 50g kale, 3 tbsp olive oil]
    - Nutrients: [12g protein, 250 mg choline, 400 mg potassium, USDA FoodData Central]
    - Preparation: [Boil eggs, steam zucchini and kale]
    - Supplements: [300 mg R-ALA]

```

**Keywords**: Meals (Lunch, Dinner), Ingredients (Eggs, Zucchini, Custom Ingredient), Nutrients (Protein, Choline, Fiber), Preparation (Boil, Steam), Supplements, Daily Total, Neuropathy Triggers, Custom Meal

### Step 6: Apply the Ingredient Evaluation Methodology
Use the **Ingredient Evaluation Methodology** in `Article10.md` to select and track foods:
1. **Select Ingredients**: Choose [INGREDIENTS, e.g., eggs, zucchini] compliant with [CONSTRAINTS, e.g., Low-Histamine, Oxalate-Free]. Eggs (~250–500 mg choline/day) support MS nerve health.
2. **Analyze Nutrients**: Use [SOURCE, e.g., USDA FoodData Central, Cronometer] to determine [NUTRIENTS, e.g., choline, fiber, potassium] per [SERVING_SIZE, e.g., 100g].
3. **Check Constraints**: Verify [HISTAMINE, LECTINS, OXALATES, FODMAPS, ALLERGENS, GLYCEMIC_INDEX, STIMULANT_CONTENT] using [SOURCES, e.g., SIGHI, Monash University, The Kidney Dietitian]. Exclude high-oxalate/stimulant foods (e.g., apples, ~20–30 mg/182g; cocoa, ~600–700 mg/100g) due to brain fog and neuropathy risks.
4. **Assess Sustainability**: Evaluate [CARBON_FOOTPRINT, LOCAL_SOURCING, ORGANIC_STATUS] if prioritized.
5. **Track Totals**: Sum [NUTRIENTS, e.g., protein, choline] per meal and daily, compare to [TARGETS, e.g., RDA, AI], adjust for [BIOAVAILABILITY, e.g., plant-based zinc].
6. **Monitor**: Track [SYMPTOMS, e.g., bloating, neuropathy, brain fog, stool consistency] and adjust [PORTIONS, e.g., reduce chicken to 100g] if needed.

**Example**:
- Ingredient: [Zucchini, 100g/sitting]
- Nutrients: [~300 mg potassium, ~1 g fiber, USDA FoodData Central]
- Constraints: [Low-Histamine, Oxalate-Free, Low-FODMAP, SIGHI, Monash University]
