# Artifact 9: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template

## Customizable Template for Weekly Meal Plan

This is **Artifact 9: Customizable Template for Weekly Meal Plan**, providing a flexible framework for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on mitochondrial health. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients**, with no strict restrictions, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. It includes tofu, green tea, turmeric, broccoli, and vinegar to support NAD/NADH, sirtuins, and reduced mTOR activity. Shopping is ordered at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, for delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**, totaling ~$128.93–$133.60. For standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md).
