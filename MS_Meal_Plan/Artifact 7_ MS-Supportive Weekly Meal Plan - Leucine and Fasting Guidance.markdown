# Artifact 7: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Leucine and Fasting Guidance

## Leucine and Fasting Guidance

This is **Artifact 7: Leucine and Fasting Guidance**, providing strategies to optimize leucine intake and intermittent fasting for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, with weaker digestive motility impacting gut function. The plan adheres to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated by reducing intake and adding tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), neuropathy from apples/cocoa (excluded), and the use of whole chickens (2 x 1.45 kg) to source bones for bone broth. The menu, based on **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md) (eggs, tinned fish, chicken, zucchini, lettuce, avocados, blueberries, pear, liver, yogurt, bone broth), delivers ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, targeting ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation to support muscle preservation and nerve health. This artifact outlines leucine sources, fasting protocols, and their integration with the menu to enhance digestion and MS management, with shopping ordered online at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 10, 2025**, and delivery on **Friday evening, June 13, 2025**.

### Importance of Leucine and Fasting in MS

- **Leucine**: An essential branched-chain amino acid that activates mTOR, promoting muscle protein synthesis and nerve health, critical for MS patients to counter muscle loss and fatigue ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/6/876/4615628)).
- **Intermittent Fasting (16:8)**: Restricting eating to an 8-hour window (12 PM–8:00 PM) enhances autophagy, reduces inflammation, and supports gut health, aiding digestion in MS ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **User Context**: Weaker digestion requires balanced leucine intake to avoid overloading the gut, with fasting tailored to minimize digestive stress ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

### Leucine Guidance

#### Target
- **Goal**: ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal (~5–7 g/day), ensuring ~57.5 g protein/meal to activate mTOR ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/6/876/4615628)).
- **Rationale**: Supports muscle preservation, nerve repair, and reduces MS-related fatigue ([Article11.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact11.md)).

#### Sources
- **Eggs**: ~0.5–0.6 g leucine/egg; 4 eggs/meal provide ~2.0–2.4 g leucine ([USDA FoodData Central, 2018](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)).
- **Tinned Sardines/Mackerel**: ~1.8–2.0 g leucine/100 g serving (Sunday/Tuesday/Friday lunch) ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
- **Chicken (from whole chickens)**: ~2.0–2.3 g leucine/100 g serving (11 meals/week) ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
- **Chicken Liver**: ~1.5–1.8 g leucine/50 g serving (Monday lunch) ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
- **Bone Broth**: Minimal leucine (~0.1–0.2 g/200 ml), supports overall protein.

#### Meal Plan Implementation
- **Lunch (12 PM)**:
  - **Sunday/Tuesday/Friday**: 4 eggs (~2.0–2.4 g leucine) + 100 g tinned fish (~1.8–2.0 g) = ~3.8–4.4 g leucine.
  - **Monday**: 4 eggs (~2.0–2.4 g) + 50 g liver (~1.5–1.8 g) + 100 g chicken (~2.0–2.3 g) = ~3.5–4.2 g leucine.
  - **Wednesday/Thursday/Saturday**: 4 eggs (~2.0–2.4 g) + 100 g chicken (~2.0–2.3 g) = ~4.0–4.7 g leucine.
- **Dinner (7:30–8:00 PM)**: 4 eggs (~2.0–2.4 g) + 100 g chicken (~2.0–2.3 g) = ~4.0–4.7 g leucine (all days).
- **Total Daily**: ~5–7 g leucine/day, meeting mTOR activation needs ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
- **Digestion**: Spread leucine evenly (lunch/dinner) to avoid gut overload, supported by fiber (~15–17.5 g/meal) from avocados, pear, zucchini ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionresearchreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

#### Compatibility
- **Low-Histamine**: Eggs, tinned fish, liver, chicken cooked fresh, consumed immediately ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Lectin-Free**: Compliant, no lectins in protein sources ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
- **Oxalate-Free**: Compliant, negligible oxalates.
- **Low-FODMAP**: Compliant, no FODMAPs in protein sources.
- **Leaky Gut/MS-Supportive**: High-quality proteins support muscle, nerve health ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).

### Intermittent Fasting Guidance

#### Protocol (16:8)
- **Eating Window**: 12 PM–8:00 PM (8 hours), fasting from 8:00 PM to 12 PM next day (16 hours).
- **Rationale**: Enhances autophagy, reduces inflammation, supports gut rest, and aligns with MS symptom management ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Schedule**:
  - **12 PM**: Lunch (first meal, breaking fast).
  - **7:30–8:00 PM**: Dinner (last meal).
  - **8:00 PM–12 PM**: Fast, hydrate with water (3 L/day, sipped, limited post-6 PM to reduce nocturia) ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).

#### Implementation
- **Preparation**: Plan meals to fit within 8-hour window, ensuring ~57.5 g protein/meal ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
- **Hydration**: Sip 3 L water during fasting (8:00 AM–12:00 PM), avoiding caffeine to prevent digestive irritation ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
- **Exercise**: Post-meal (12:30 PM, 8:00–8:30 PM, 10 sets MS-adjusted movements) to leverage leucine for mTOR activation ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).
- **Digestion**: Fasting supports gut rest, complemented by bone broth, yogurt for motility ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionresearchreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

#### Compatibility
- **Low-Histamine**: Fasting compliant, no food intake during fast ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Lectin-Free/Oxalate-Free/Low-FODMAP**: Compliant, fasting avoids food-related triggers.
- **Leaky Gut/MS-Supportive**: Reduces gut inflammation, supports nerve health ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

### Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Track**:
  - **Cronometer**: Log protein (~115 g/day), leucine (~2.5–3.5 g/meal, ~5–7 g/day), ensuring meal timing aligns with fasting window ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
  - **MySymptoms**: Log:
    - **Fatigue**: Energy (1–10 scale) post-meals, fasting.
    - **Constipation**: Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Chart, Type 3–4 ideal) post-meals.
    - **Bloating**: Discomfort (1–10 scale) post-meals.
    - **Sleep**: Quality (1–10 scale) during fasting ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Adjust**:
  - **Leucine/Fatigue**: If leucine, increase chicken to 125 g/serving (consult dietitian) ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
  - **Constipation**: Increase avocado to 50 g/serving, pear to 100 g/day to support digestion during eating window ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
  - **Bloating**: Reduce tinned fish to 75 g/serving, ensure small avocado portions (30 g) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
  - **Fasting/Sleep**: If hunger disrupts sleep, shorten fasting window to 14:10 (10:00 AM–8:00 PM), consult neurologist ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
- **Consult**: Share **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms** data with dietitian/neurologist after 1–2 weeks ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **SuperGrok**: Query for leucine optimization (e.g., “MS-safe leucine sources”) or fasting adjustments (e.g., “16:8 fasting for MS digestion”). Available via **SuperGrok** subscription on grok.com (visit https://x.ai/grok for pricing) ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).

### Notes

- **Synergies**: Leucine-rich meals (eggs, tinned fish, chicken) paired with fasting reduce inflammation, support muscle and nerve health ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **Digestive Support**: Fasting and high-fiber foods (avocados, pear, ~30–35 g/day) address weaker motility, with bone broth aiding gut repair ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionresearchreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Whole Chickens**: Two 1.45 kg chickens provide meat (~1100 g for 11 meals) and bone broth (~2000 ml) ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **AIP Compliance**: Nightshade-free, includes liver, yogurt ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Accessibility**: Clear leucine and fasting guidance accommodates MS cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
