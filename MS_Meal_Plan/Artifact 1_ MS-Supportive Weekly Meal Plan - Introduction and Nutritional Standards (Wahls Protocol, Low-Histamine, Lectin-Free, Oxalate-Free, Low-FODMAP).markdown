# Artifact 1: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Introduction and Nutritional Standards

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards**, providing an overview and nutritional framework for a 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. The plan adheres to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and incorporating **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles to reduce inflammation, support gut health, and manage MS symptoms ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)). It delivers ~115 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, targeting ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal to activate mTOR, enhanced by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) at 12:30 PM and 8:00–8:30 PM to promote muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and nerve health ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)). User observations note eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated by reducing intake and adding tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), and neuropathy from apples and 95% cocoa bars (excluded). The menu includes tinned fish (100 g/serving, 3 times/week), avocados (30 g/serving, 3 times/week), blueberries (75 g/serving, 3 times/week), tart cherries (45 g/serving, 3 times/week), and pear (50 g/serving, 1 time/week) to address constipation and support gut hormone regulation, inspired by flavonoid benefits ([News-Medical, 2025](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250326/Flavonoids-help-regulate-gut-hormones-and-show-promise-in-managing-type-2-diabetes.aspx)). Chicken (~100 g/meal) and kale (~25 g/serving) are reduced, with chicken liver (50 g/serving, 2 times/week), coconut yogurt (1 tbsp/serving, 2 times/week), and nightshade elimination maintained per AIP principles ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)). The plan ensures ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables (~4.5–6 cups cooked), ~30–35 g/day fiber, and ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day, with foods cooked fresh and consumed immediately to minimize histamine ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)). This artifact outlines nutritional standards and plan goals, accessible for MS-related cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).

## Nutritional Standards

### Goals
- **Reduce Inflammation**: Eliminate high-histamine, lectin-containing, oxalate-rich, high-FODMAP, and inflammatory foods (e.g., nightshades, apples, cocoa), incorporating AIP principles (e.g., chicken liver, coconut yogurt) to minimize MS flare-ups ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888)).
- **Support Nerve Health**: Provide choline (~500–625 mg/day from eggs), omega-3s (~1–2 g/100 g tinned fish), B vitamins (from liver), and supplements (e.g., R-ALA, methylcobalamin) to aid myelin repair and reduce neuropathy ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)).
- **Improve Gut Health**: Include ~30–35 g/day fiber (e.g., zucchini, avocados, pear) and prebiotics (e.g., coconut yogurt) to address constipation, support microbiome diversity, and reduce leaky gut, enhanced by flavonoids (e.g., blueberries, tart cherries) ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Enhance Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS)**: Deliver ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal (from eggs, tinned fish, chicken, liver) to activate mTOR, supported by post-meal exercise, to maintain muscle mass and release myokines (e.g., BDNF) for nerve health ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/6/876/4615628)).
- **Optimize Energy and Sleep**: Ensure ~120–150 g/day fat (e.g., olive oil, avocados), ~7–8 hours sleep via choline, melatonin (tart cherries), and magnesium citrate, addressing alertness and fatigue ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).

### Macronutrient and Micronutrient Targets
- **Protein**: ~115 g/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.5 g/meal), sourced from eggs (~90 g/week), tinned fish (~75 g/week), chicken (~625 g/week), liver (~25 g/week), and bone broth (~80 g/week), ensuring ~5–7 g leucine/day ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Leucine**: ~2.5–3.5 g/meal (~5–7 g/day), from eggs (~0.5–0.6 g/egg), tinned fish (~1.8–2.0 g/100 g), chicken (~2.0–2.3 g/100 g), liver (~1.5–1.8 g/50 g), to stimulate mTOR and MPS ([Article11.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact11.md)).
- **Fat**: ~120–150 g/day (~60–75 g/meal), from olive oil (~42 g/3 tbsp), avocados (~4.5 g/30 g), and tinned fish, supporting ketosis and energy needs ([The Wahls Protocol, 2020](https://terrywahls.com/)).
- **Fiber**: ~30–35 g/day, from zucchini (~1.5 g/150 g), avocados (~2.1 g/30 g), blueberries (~1.8 g/75 g), tart cherries (~0.9 g/45 g), pear (~1.5 g/50 g), and other vegetables (~12–18 g/day), addressing constipation ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Vegetables**: ~9–10 cups/day raw (~4.5–6 cups cooked), including greens (e.g., kale, lettuce), sulfur-rich (e.g., bok choy), and colorful (e.g., carrots, radishes), providing ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day ([USDA FoodData Central, 2018](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)).
- **Potassium**: ~3,700–4,300 mg/day, from zucchini (~450 mg/150 g), potatoes (~1600 mg/400 g), avocados (~145 mg/30 g), and other vegetables, supporting nerve function ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
- **Choline**: ~500–625 mg/day, from eggs (~125 mg/egg), supporting myelin and alertness ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)).
- **Iodine**: ~560–1400 µg/week, from sea vegetables (~80–200 µg/20 g) and seaweed snacks (~100 µg/sheet), supporting thyroid function ([Nutrients, 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/6/1718)).
- **Supplements**: R-ALA (600 mg/day), Benfotiamine (300 mg/day), P5P (80 mg/day), Methylcobalamin (1000 µg/day), Folate (400 µg/day), L-Citrulline (1000 mg/day), Acetyl-L-Carnitine (1000 mg/day), Creatine (5 g/day), Magnesium Citrate (200–400 mg/day) for nerve health, energy, and sleep ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).

### Dietary Constraints
- **Low-Histamine**: Foods (e.g., tinned fish, eggs, chicken, liver, yogurt) are fresh, cooked immediately, consumed within 24 hours, or refrigerated (35–40°F) to minimize histamine. Avoid aged/fermented foods (e.g., shiitake mushrooms, cheeses) ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Lectin-Free**: Peel vegetables (e.g., zucchini, potatoes, ginger, avocados, pear) and avoid legumes/nightshades to reduce gut irritation ([Front Plant Sci., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.01365/full)).
- **Oxalate-Free (<10 mg/100g)**: Select low-oxalate foods (e.g., zucchini, lettuce, avocados ~0.5–1 mg/30 g), monitor moderate-oxalate fruits (blueberries ~18.5 mg/75 g, tart cherries ~4.5–6.75 mg/45 g), exclude high-oxalate foods (e.g., apples, cocoa) to prevent neuropathy ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **Low-FODMAP**: Limit servings (e.g., avocado 30 g, blueberries 75 g, tart cherries 45 g, pear 50 g) to minimize digestive discomfort, avoid high-FODMAP foods (e.g., onions, green tea) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Leaky Gut/MS-Supportive**: Include gut-healing foods (e.g., bone broth, coconut yogurt), exclude irritants (e.g., dairy, nightshades), and support nerve health with omega-3s, B vitamins, and flavonoids ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

### Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Track Symptoms**: Use **MySymptoms** or **Cronometer** to log:
  - **Constipation**: Stool consistency (post-tinned fish, avocado, pear) using Bristol Stool Chart.
  - **Neuropathy**: Tingling post-blueberries/tart cherries.
  - **Histamine**: Flushing post-tinned fish.
  - **Bloating**: Discomfort post-avocado/yogurt/cherries ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
  - **Sleep/Alertness**: Improvements post-eggs ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
- **Adjustments**:
  - **Constipation**: Increase avocado to 50 g/serving, pear to 100 g/serving, or reduce chicken to 50 g/meal if persistent ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
  - **Neuropathy**: Reduce blueberries to 50 g, tart cherries to 30 g, consult neurologist if tingling worsens ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888)).
  - **Histamine**: Reduce tinned fish to 50 g/serving or switch to fresh salmon if flushing occurs ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
  - **Bloating**: Discontinue yogurt, reduce avocado to 20 g/serving, substitute pear (~50 g) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/), [Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Consult Experts**: Share logs with a dietitian or neurologist after 1–2 weeks to optimize nutrient intake and symptom management ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

### Notes
- **Budget**: ~£70.27–£71.94 for food/staples, ~£105.39–£109.06 with supplements, supports menu with tinned fish, avocados, berries, and pear ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **Accessibility**: Clear structure and tracking tools (e.g., **MySymptoms**) accommodate MS cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **Flavonoid Benefits**: Blueberries and tart cherries support gut hormone regulation, monitored for oxalate/FODMAP limits to prevent neuropathy ([News-Medical, 2025](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250326/Flavonoids-help-regulate-gut-hormones-and-show-promise-in-managing-type-2-diabetes.aspx)).
- **AIP Synergy**: Chicken liver, coconut yogurt, nightshade elimination, and stress management (meditation, yoga) reduce inflammation, complementing dietary changes ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
