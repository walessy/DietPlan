# Artifact 1: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Introduction and Nutritional Standards

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards**, outlining the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 63.5 kg. The plan aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) to support MS management, delivering ~102g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~51g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a **16:8 intermittent fasting schedule** (12 PM–8 PM eating window, fasting 8 PM–12 PM, no breakfast). For fasting details, see **Artifact 8: Notes 2 - Leucine and Fasting Guidance** (./Article8.md). It ensures all 9 essential amino acids (EAAs), Vitamin B12 (~2.5–3.0 µg/day from food, supplemented to ~1000 µg/day), and choline (~500 mg/day from 2–4 eggs/day) to support leaky gut, constipation, bowel-bladder issues, neuropathic pain, post-antibiotic gut issues, and MS needs, particularly **neuropathy prevention**. User observations indicate eggs (2–4/day) improve alertness and sleep quality, while chicken may cause hard stools, addressed by increasing fiber (~30–35g/day, e.g., zucchini) and hydration. Apples and cocoa are excluded due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants causing brain fog, digestive discomfort, and worsened neuropathy. For neuropathy strategies, see **Artifact 4: Nerve Health Support** (./Article4.md).

The plan uses **whole chicken**, **chicken breasts**, **wild Alaskan salmon** (fresh, cooked immediately, no reheating), and **eggs** to prevent histamine formation ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)). Bone broth (~2800ml prepared, 14 x 200ml, ~2000ml consumed) from ~1400g chicken bones is frozen, defrosted daily, and heated once, with excess accounting for preparation losses. For preparation details, see **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule** (./Article2.md). It includes ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables (~4.5–6 cups cooked, ~600–800g, assuming ~2:1 raw-to-cooked ratio for kale, 1:1 for lettuce): ~3 cups greens (kale, butter leaf lettuce, bok choy, sea vegetables), ~3 cups sulfur-rich (cabbage, radishes, garlic), ~3 cups colorful (carrots, celery, blueberries, tart cherries, white potato), all lectin-free (peeled where needed) and low-FODMAP, with most oxalate-free (<10 mg/100g cooked). **Blueberries** (~50g/sitting, ~0.5 cup raw, ~12.5 mg oxalates) and **tart cherries** (~30g/sitting, ~0.3 cup raw, ~3–4.5 mg oxalates) are included as colorful fruits, with monitoring for oxalate and FODMAP sensitivity due to moderate oxalate levels exceeding the <10 mg/100g threshold for blueberries ([The Wahls Protocol, 2020](https://terrywahls.com/), [Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)). Apples (~20–30 mg oxalates/182g) and cocoa (~600–700 mg oxalates/100g) are avoided due to digestive and neurological adverse effects ([The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/), [Artifact 7: Non-Plan Content](5f0d0a1d-f7fd-44f7-aacc-5c51fc3876c6)). For food compatibility, see **Artifact 7: Non-Plan Content** (./Article7.md). **Kale** (~350g/week, ~50g/day cooked, ~100g/day raw, ~1 cup raw/sitting, curly/Tuscan/baby) is reduced from a prior plan’s 600g (~86g/sitting) for palatability, with **butter leaf lettuce** (~100–200g/sitting, ~2–4 cups raw), **bok choy** (~100g/sitting, ~2 cups raw), and **zucchini** (~100g/sitting, ~1 cup raw) meeting ~3 cups greens/day and boosting fiber.

New foods include **celery** (~50g/sitting), **wild Alaskan salmon** (~100g/sitting), **garlic** (~5g/sitting), **blueberries** (~50g/sitting), **tart cherries** (~30g/sitting), **sea vegetables** (~20g/sitting), and increased **eggs** (~2–4/day where needed), replacing cucumber, apple, and some chicken to reduce constipation risk. Incompatible foods (beetroot, shiitake mushrooms, green tea, almond butter, pumpkin seeds, whey protein, apples, cocoa) are excluded due to oxalate, FODMAP, lectin, histamine, or dairy issues ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/), [Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)). For exclusion rationale, see **Artifact 7: Non-Plan Content** (./Article7.md). Phosphorus compounds (e.g., phosphate salts, phosphatidylserine) evaluated for deep sleep were excluded due to insufficient evidence; see **Artifact 9: Notes 4 - Deep Sleep Supplementation Guidance** (./Article9.md). **Plenish Spirulina Detox** (~30ml/day) adds antioxidants ([Front Nutr., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00132/full)). **Supplements** (R-ALA, Benfotiamine, P5P, Methylcobalamin, 5-MTHF, L-Citrulline, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Creatine, magnesium citrate) address nerve health, as foods can’t provide therapeutic doses except folate (~223–429 µg/day, supplemented) and choline (~500 mg/day from eggs) ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)). Magnesium citrate (~200–400 mg/day, with dinner at ~7:30–8:00 PM) enhances deep sleep and bowel regularity ([Nutrients, 2017](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/7/767), [Artifact 9: Notes 4](305b3595-88ef-44c7-acce-bcba556a813d)).

The plan provides ~340–390 mg magnesium/day from diet, supplemented with ~200–400 mg/day magnesium citrate, ~80–200 µg iodine/day (seaweed, sea vegetables), ~30–35 g fiber/day (increased to prevent constipation), and ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day, supporting MS and neuropathy prevention ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)). Some nutrients (calcium, Vitamin D, omega-3s, iodine) are below RDA/AI, mitigated by salmon and monitoring ([Neurology, 2018](https://n.neurology.org/content/90/20/e1859)). It adheres to low-histamine, lectin-free, low-FODMAP, gluten-free, dairy-free, **Healthy Keto/AIP-like** principles, with a budget of ~£60.94–£62.61 (excluding supplements), slightly above the original ~£56–£59 target due to salmon, blueberries, tart cherries, and magnesium citrate (see **Artifact 5: Shopping List** (./Article5.md)). Shopping occurs Thursday, June 12, 2025. For scientific sources, see **Artifact 6: References** (./Article6.md).

   - Save as `Article1.md` in the `MS_Meal_Plan` folder, overwriting the existing `Article1.md` to update it.
   - Ensure the `.md` extension is used.

2. **Verify File**:
   - Open `Article1.md` in a Markdown reader (e.g., Markdown Reader, https://markdownreader.github.io/) or editor (e.g., Obsidian, Typora).
   - Check that cross-references (e.g., `./Article3.md`) are correct and will resolve once corresponding files are updated.

3. **Folder Structure**:
   - Ensure `MS_Meal_Plan` folder contains `ToC.md`, `Article1.md`, and placeholders for `Article2.md` through `Article11.md` (to be updated as requested).

### Next Steps
I’ve provided the updated `Article1.md` as requested, incorporating your dietary observations, using relative file paths, and maintaining accessibility. Please confirm the following to proceed:

- **Confirm Article1.md**: Verify if the updated `Article1.md` is suitable, or specify any changes needed.
- **Request Next Artifact**: Indicate which artifact to update next (e.g., “Provide updated Article2.md”), and I’ll deliver it as a separate `<xaiArtifact>` block with your dietary observations, relative paths, and accessibility features.
- **File Compilation**:
  - If you want a **Python script** to combine `ToC.md` and `Article1.md` through `Article11.md` into a single Markdown document once all are updated, confirm your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  - If you prefer a **PDF via LaTeX**, confirm if you can handle LaTeX source (I’ll provide a `.tex` file) or need a structure for external compilation (e.g., Overleaf instructions).
