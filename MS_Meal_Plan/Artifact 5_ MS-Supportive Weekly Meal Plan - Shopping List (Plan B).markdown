# Artifact 5: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Shopping List (Plan B)

## Shopping List

This is **Artifact 5: Shopping List (Plan B)**, detailing ingredients for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients** (e.g., lectins, phytates), delivering ~100 g protein/day (~50 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. The streamlined, low-cost menu incorporates **kiwi fruit** for its vitamin C, fiber, and flavonoids, and **lean ground beef** (480 g, ~68.6 g/meal, 7 meals/week) for its protein, zinc, and niacin, addresses user preferences (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, exclusion of apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no chicken meat to avoid constipation), and minimizes complexity. Shopping is ordered at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, for delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**, totaling ~$82.39–$92.39. For menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for nutritional standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md); for food compatibility, see **Artifact 6** (./Article6.md).

### Shopping List (Tuesday, June 17, 2025)

#### Protein Sources
- **Tinned Sardines/Mackerel**: 7 x 125 g cans (~$8.75, ASDA International Aisle, Wild Planet, bone-in).
- **Lean Ground Beef (90% lean)**: 480 g (~$2.88, ASDA Fresh Meat Aisle, fresh, refrigerated).
- **Eggs**: 30 medium eggs (~$6.76, 2 x 15, ASDA Dairy Aisle).

#### Vegetables

#### Fruits

- **Range**: ~$82.39–$92.39, depending on ASDA pricing fluctuations (e.g., seasonal produce, brand variations). Savings of ~$10–$30 achieved compared to Plan A (~$100–$110) by using fewer foods, frozen broccoli, and lean ground beef.

### Notes
- **Storage**:
  - **Lean Ground Beef (480 g)**: On delivery (June 20), refrigerate at 35–40°F in original packaging or airtight container. Divide into ~240 g (Batch 1, June 25), ~120 g (Batch 2, June 29), ~120 g (Batch 3, July 1). Freeze two ~120 g portions in freezer bags (labeled “June 29”, “July 1”) at 0°F. Thaw Batch 2 in fridge (June 28 evening, 8–12 hours) for June 29 cooking, Batch 3 (June 30 evening) for July 1 cooking. Refrigerate cooked portions (35–40°F, airtight containers) for up to 4 days (Batch 1: June 25–28; Batch 2: June 29–30; Batch 3: July 1) ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
  - **Other Items**: Refrigerate eggs, milk, fish, kiwi, parsley at 35–40°F; store potatoes in a cool, dark place (50–60°F); keep frozen broccoli at 0°F; freeze excess fish cans if needed.
- **Preparation**:
  - **Lean Ground Beef**: Batch 1 (~240 g, June 25): Sauté in 1 tbsp olive oil (165°F internal temperature, ~5–7 min), portion into 3.5 x ~68.6 g for June 25–28 dinners, refrigerate, use by June 28. Batch 2 (~120 g, June 29): Thaw, cook, portion into 1.75 x ~68.6 g for June 29–30 dinners, use by June 30. Batch 3 (~120 g, July 1): Thaw, cook, use ~68.6 g for July 1 dinner, refrigerate remainder (~51.4 g) for July 2. Consume/refrigerate within 2 hours; reheat to 165°F ([USDA Food Safety, 2020](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/)).
  - **Other Items**: Boil eggs, fish, potatoes; steam broccoli; consume kiwi raw; refrigerate prepared foods at 35–40°F, use within 24 hours to minimize histamine; no soaking required ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
- **Sourcing**: All items available at ASDA, with alternatives (e.g., Tesco, Sainsbury’s) if out of stock. Verify Wild Planet tinned fish and fresh beef (90% lean, bright red) for low-histamine compliance; choose firm kiwi and quality frozen broccoli for cost savings ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **Budget Management**: Remaining budget (~$23.04–$33.04) allows flexibility for price variations or future additions (e.g., oranges if kiwi causes bloating) ([Article9.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact9.md)).
- **Nutrient Alignment**: Supports **mitochondrial health** with cofactors (**thiamine** ~1.5 mg/day, **niacin** ~20 mg NE/day, **magnesium** ~350 mg/day, **vitamin D** ~2600–3600 IU/day), flavonoids (~250–350 mg/day from kiwi, green tea, parsley), and **alpha-lipoic acid** (broccoli) and **acetic acid** (vinegar), addressing MS symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, constipation) ([Article1.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact1.md)).
