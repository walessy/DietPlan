# Artifact 2: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

## Daily Routine

This is **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule**, detailing the daily schedule and food preparation for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS. The plan supports **16:8 intermittent fasting**, ~102g protein/day, ~30–35g fiber/day (increased to prevent constipation from chicken), and neuropathy prevention, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol**. Eggs (2–4/day) improve alertness and sleep quality due to choline (~500 mg/day), while chicken may cause hard stools, mitigated with increased fiber (e.g., zucchini, ~100g/sitting) and hydration (3L/day). Apples and cocoa are avoided due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants causing brain fog, digestive discomfort, and worsened neuropathy. For meal details, see **Artifact 3: Menu** (./Article3.md); for nutritional standards, see **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards** (./Article1.md); for sleep supplementation, see **Artifact 9: Notes 4 - Deep Sleep Supplementation Guidance** (./Article9.md).

**Morning Ritual (7:00 AM)**:
- **Wake**: ~7:00 AM, after ~8 hours sleep (~11:00 PM–7:00 AM) to reduce MS fatigue and support circadian alignment ([Sleep Med Rev., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079217301551)). For sleep optimization, see **Artifact 9: Notes 4** (./Article9.md).
- Hydration: 300ml water upon waking, critical for MS bladder/gut function and preventing constipation ([The Wahls Protocol, 2020](https://terrywahls.com/)).
- Non-Dietary: Diaphragmatic breathing (5 min, 2x/day); stand/walk 5–10 min/hour, MS-adjusted ([Physiother Res Int., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.2087)). **No food** (fasting).
- Exercise: 20–30 min/day (~7:30–8:00 AM, resistance bands, walking, MS-adjusted), boosts nitric oxide/myokines to support nerve health ([Nitric Oxide, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089860318300146), [Front Immunol., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.01516/full)). For myokine benefits, see **Artifact 4: Nerve Health Support** (./Article4.md).

**Fasting**: 16:8 (12 PM–8 PM eating, fasting 8 PM–12 PM), two meals (~51g protein/meal, ~120–150g fat, ~1,500–1,600 kcal) ([Neurosci News, 2018](https://neurosciencenews.com/intermittent-fasting-neuroprotection-9845/)). For fasting guidance, see **Artifact 8: Notes 2 - Leucine and Fasting Guidance** (./Article8.md). Hydration: 3L water/day, sipped steadily to support digestion and prevent constipation, limit after ~6:00 PM to minimize nocturia ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

**Supplements and Spirulina**:
- **Lunch (12 PM)**: 300 mg R-ALA (~£0.50), 150 mg Benfotiamine (~£0.15), 40 mg P5P (~£0.11), 500 µg Methylcobalamin (~£0.08, sublingual), 200 µg 5-MTHF (~£0.10), 500 mg L-Citrulline (~£0.05), 500 mg Acetyl-L-Carnitine (~£0.25), 5g Creatine (~£0.05), 30ml Plenish Spirulina Detox (~£1.14). For supplement sourcing, see **Artifact 5: Shopping List** (./Article5.md).
- **Dinner (7:30–8:00 PM)**: Same as lunch, plus 200–400 mg magnesium citrate (~£0.10–£0.20) to enhance deep sleep and bowel regularity, addressing chicken-related constipation ([Nutrients, 2017](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/7/767), [Artifact 9: Notes 4](305b3595-88ef-44c7-acce-bcba556a813d)). Timing provides leucine (~3–5.5 g from ~150g chicken, 2–4 eggs, or ~100g salmon) ~3–3.5 hours before bed (~11:00 PM) for overnight muscle protein synthesis, within the 12 PM–8 PM eating window ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/6/876/4615628), [Am J Clin Nutr., 2015](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/101/3/479/4499917), [Artifact 8: Notes 2](7b31b3c5-9747-44b1-8d7d-fa41fff14b5e)).
- **Storage**: Refrigerate supplements/spirulina at 35–40°F to maintain low-histamine properties ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).

**Evening Routine (10:00–11:00 PM)**:
- ~10:00–10:30 PM: Dim lights, avoid screens (reduce blue light), practice diaphragmatic breathing (5 min) to relax and support sleep ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- ~10:30 PM: Bathroom visit to minimize nocturia, aiding MS bladder management ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Bedtime**: ~11:00 PM, in a dark, quiet, cool room (~60–67°F) with a supportive mattress to reduce spasticity and enhance deep sleep ([Sleep Med Rev., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079217301551), [Artifact 9: Notes 4](305b3595-88ef-44c7-acce-bcba556a813d)).

**Non-Dietary Tip**: Use a footstool during bowel movements to reduce straining, aiding constipation relief, especially after high-protein meals like chicken ([Physiother Res Int., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.2087)).

**Store Notes**: ASDA items (receipt, June 12, 2025): salt, olive oil, celery, zucchini, parsley, potato, kale (350g), carrots, cabbage, blueberries (100g), tart cherries (60g), radishes, lettuce, bok choy, garlic, ginger, sea vegetables, chicken, salmon, eggs, spirulina (Fresh Produce, Meat, Fish, Juice, International Aisles); magnesium citrate (Pharmacy/Online). Seaweed (International), turmeric (Spices), supplements (pharmacy/online, e.g., Holland & Barrett). Peel zucchini, carrots, potato, ginger to remove lectins. Avoid apples and cocoa in stores due to high oxalates and neurological risks. For full sourcing, see **Artifact 5: Shopping List** (./Article5.md).

## Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

This section of **Artifact 2** outlines the defrosting and cooking schedule to ensure low-histamine compliance and alignment with the meal plan’s 12 PM–8 PM eating window. Chicken (except one whole chicken refrigerated for Sunday) and salmon are frozen upon purchase. Defrost in refrigerator (24–48 hours for 1.45kg chicken, 24 hours for ~500g breasts/~200g salmon). Cook fresh daily, consume immediately, **no reheating** to prevent histamine formation ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)). Freeze excess raw meat within 2 hours; cooked meat in 150g portions for future use. Bone broth (~2800ml, 14 x 200ml) from ~1400g chicken bones (Tuesday), frozen, defrosted daily, heated once to 165°F/74°C. Kale (~350g/week) used fresh (~200–300g) or defrosted (if blanched), cooked fresh. Zucchini (~100g/sitting) added to meals to increase fiber (~30–35g/day) for constipation relief. Blueberries (~100g/week) and tart cherries (~60g/week) used fresh, consumed immediately to maintain low-histamine and low-FODMAP properties; apples and cocoa strictly avoided due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants. Sea vegetables (~140g/week) soaked/cooked fresh. Spirulina (~30ml/day) refrigerated at 35–40°F, consumed immediately. Shopping occurs Thursday, June 12, 2025 ([USDA, 2023](https://www.usda.gov/)).
