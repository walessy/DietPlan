# Artifact 9: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Dietary Plan Template

## Customizable Dietary Plan Template

This is **Artifact 9: Customizable Dietary Plan Template**, providing a flexible template for creating a 7-day meal plan tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and incorporating **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** elements. The template supports ~114.9 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.4 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, targeting ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mTOR activation, enhanced by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements, e.g., bodyweight squats, resistance band rows) after lunch (12:30 PM) and dinner (8:00–8:30 PM) to promote muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and nerve health ([Am J Clin Nutr., 2015](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/101/3/479/4499917)). User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, while chicken may cause hard stools, mitigated with ~30–35 g/day fiber (e.g., zucchini) and 3 L/day water. Apples and cocoa are excluded due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants worsening neuropathy and brain fog. This template allows customization of foods, quantities, and schedules while maintaining dietary constraints, with guidance on tracking and adjustments. For plan overview, see **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards** (./Article1.md); for example menu, see **Artifact 3: Menu** (./Article3.md); for schedule/exercise, see **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule** (./Article2.md); for usage instructions, see **Artifact 10: Guide to Using the Customizable Dietary Plan Template** (./Article10.md); for food compatibility, see **Artifact 6: Non-Plan Content** (./Article6.md); for exercise routine, see **Artifact 12: Post-Meal Exercise Routine** (./Article12.md); for AIP integration, see **Artifact 13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration** (./Article13.md).

### Notes
- **Constraints**: All foods must be low-histamine (fresh, no reheating), lectin-free (peel where needed), oxalate-free (<10 mg/100g, monitor blueberries/tart cherries), low-FODMAP, leaky gut/MS-supportive, and AIP-compliant (e.g., exclude nightshades like tomatoes, peppers) ([Article6: Non-Plan Content](./Article6.md)).
- **Leucine/Exercise**: Ensure ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal (e.g., 150 g chicken, 50 g liver, 4 eggs) and 30-min post-meal exercise (10 sets) to support MPS and nerve health ([Article7: Leucine and Fasting Guidance](./Article7.md)).
- **Avoidances**: Exclude apples, cocoa, beetroot, whey, and nightshades due to oxalates, FODMAPs, histamine, dairy, or inflammation, preventing neuropathy ([Article6: Non-Plan Content](./Article6.md)).
- **AIP Compliance**: Include AIP-compatible foods (e.g., liver, coconut yogurt) and stress management (e.g., meditation, yoga) to reduce inflammation ([Article13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration](./Article13.md]).
- **SuperGrok**: Query for custom meals (e.g., “Leucine-rich, low-histamine lunch for MS”) or adjustments (e.g., “MS-safe exercise”). Available via **SuperGrok** subscription on grok.com (visit https://x.ai/grok for pricing) ([Article10: Guide](./Article10.md]).
