# Artifact 1: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Introduction and Nutritional Standards

## Introduction and Nutritional Standards

This is **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards**, providing an overview and nutritional framework for a 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, with weaker digestive motility impacting gut function. The plan adheres to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles. User feedback highlights eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated by reducing intake and adding tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), neuropathy from apples and cocoa (excluded), and the use of whole chickens (2 x 1.45 kg) to source bones for bone broth. The plan delivers ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, targeting ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation, supported by 30-minute post-meal exercise (12:30 PM, 8:00–8:30 PM, 10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements). It ensures ~30–35 g fiber/day, ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables, and ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day, prioritizing gut-healing and high-fiber foods (e.g., bone broth, avocados, pear) to address digestive motility. Shopping is ordered online at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 10, 2025**, with delivery on **Friday evening, June 13, 2025**. This artifact introduces the plan’s purpose, nutritional standards, and structure, with detailed schedules in **Artifact 2** (./Article2.md), menu in **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md), shopping in **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md), tracking in **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md), and AIP guidance in **Artifact 13** (./Article13.md).

### Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune condition affecting the central nervous system, characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and symptoms such as fatigue, spasticity, neuropathy, and cognitive impairment ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)). Diet and lifestyle interventions, like **The Wahls Protocol**, can mitigate symptoms by reducing inflammation, supporting nerve health, and improving gut function ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)). This meal plan addresses the user’s specific needs:
- **Weaker Digestive Motility**: Chronic constipation, exacerbated by chicken and kale, is mitigated with gut-healing foods (bone broth, coconut yogurt), high-fiber options (avocados, pear, blueberries, ~30–35 g/day), and stress management (yoga, meditation) to support gut microbiota and motility ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Sleep and Alertness**: Eggs (~500–625 mg choline/day) improve cognitive function and rest, supported by flavonoid-rich blueberries ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)).
- **Neuropathy Prevention**: Excludes apples, cocoa, and nightshades (e.g., tomatoes, peppers) to avoid tingling, with low-oxalate foods (pear, avocados) to minimize nerve irritation ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888)).
- **Inflammation Reduction**: AIP-compliant foods (chicken liver, nightshade-free) and tinned fish (omega-3s) reduce MS flare-ups ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Whole Chickens**: Two 1.45 kg chickens provide ~1100 g meat (11 meals) and ~2000 ml bone broth, addressing sourcing needs and supporting gut health ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).

The plan simplifies implementation using a minimal menu (eggs, tinned fish, chicken, zucchini, lettuce, avocados, blueberries, pear, liver, yogurt, bone broth) from **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md), with a budget of ~£100.95–£104.62.

### Nutritional Standards

The following standards ensure the plan meets dietary constraints and MS-supportive goals, based on **The Wahls Protocol** and user requirements:

1. **Protein**:
   - **Target**: ~115 g/day (~57.5 g/meal, ~1.6 g/kg body weight), supporting muscle preservation and mTOR activation ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/6/876/4615628)).
   - **Sources**: Eggs (~180 g protein/week), tinned fish (~75 g protein/week), chicken from whole chickens (~275 g protein/week), liver (~12.5 g protein/week), bone broth (~80 g protein/week) ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
   - **Leucine**: ~2.5–3.5 g/meal (~5–7 g/day), from eggs (~0.5–0.6 g/egg), tinned fish (~1.8–2.0 g/100 g), chicken (~2.0–2.3 g/100 g), liver (~1.5–1.8 g/50 g), for mTOR signaling ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md)).
