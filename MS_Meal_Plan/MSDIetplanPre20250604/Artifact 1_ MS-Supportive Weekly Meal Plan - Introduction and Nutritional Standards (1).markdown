# Artifact 1: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Introduction and Nutritional Standards

## Introduction and Nutritional Standards

This is **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards**, providing an overview and nutritional framework for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, with weaker digestive motility impacting gut function. The plan prioritizes **MS-supportive** goals, favoring **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients** (e.g., lectins, phytates), with no strict **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free**, **low-FODMAP**, or **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** restrictions, and incorporates **The Wahls Protocol** principles for mitochondrial health and neuroprotection. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken (mitigated by reducing intake and adding tofu, lentils, and flavonoid-rich foods), neuropathy from apples and cocoa (excluded), and the use of whole chickens (2 x 1.45 kg) to source meat and bone broth. The plan delivers ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, targeting ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for balanced mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, supported by 30-minute post-meal exercise (12:30 PM, 8:00–8:30 PM, 10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements). It ensures ~30–35 g fiber/day, ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables, ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day, ~1,000–1,200 mg/day calcium, ~2,000–4,000 IU/day vitamin D, and ~200–500 mg/day flavonoids, incorporating foods like tofu (genistein), green tea (EGCG), turmeric (curcumin), lipoic acid-rich broccoli, and vinegar (acetic acid) to support mitochondrial function, NAD/NADH and FAD/FADH2 cycles, mitophagy, sirtuins, and telomere maintenance. Shopping is ordered online at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, with delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**, totaling ~$128.93–$133.60. This artifact introduces the plan’s purpose, nutritional standards, and structure, with detailed schedules in **Artifact 2** (./Article2.md), menu in **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md), shopping in **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md), tracking in **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md), and guidance in **Artifact 13** (./Article13.md).

### Introduction

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune condition affecting the central nervous system, characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and symptoms such as fatigue, spasticity, neuropathy, and cognitive impairment ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)). Diet and lifestyle interventions can mitigate symptoms by supporting mitochondrial health, reducing inflammation, and enhancing gut function ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)). This meal plan addresses the user’s specific needs:

- **Weaker Digestive Motility**: Chronic constipation is mitigated with high-fiber foods (lentils, tofu, broccoli, strawberries, ~38.99 g/day fiber), gut-healing options (bone broth, lactose-free milk), and blood sugar stabilizers (vinegar) to support gut microbiota and motility ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Sleep and Alertness**: Eggs (~500–625 mg choline/day) and flavonoid-rich strawberries (~249.14–480.78 mg/day) improve cognitive function and rest ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)).
- **Neuropathy Prevention**: Excludes apples/cocoa, favoring low-oxalate foods (cucumber, green beans, broccoli) to minimize nerve irritation ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888)).
- **Inflammation Reduction**: Includes tofu (genistein), green tea (EGCG), turmeric (curcumin), and broccoli (alpha-lipoic acid) to reduce neuroinflammation, support mitophagy, sirtuins, and reduce mTOR activity ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Whole Chickens**: Two 1.45 kg chickens provide ~1100 g meat (11 meals) and ~4000 ml bone broth, supporting gut health ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).

The plan simplifies implementation using a menu (eggs, tinned fish, turkey, chicken, zucchini, cucumber, bok choy, romaine lettuce, green beans, butternut squash, broccoli, avocados, blueberries, strawberries, pear, tofu, liver, bone broth, lactose-free milk, fortified oat milk, lentils, flaxseeds, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, nutritional yeast, parsley, green tea, turmeric, vinegar) from **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md), with a budget of ~$128.93–$133.60.
