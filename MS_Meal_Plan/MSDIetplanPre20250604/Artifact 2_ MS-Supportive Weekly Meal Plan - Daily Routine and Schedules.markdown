# Artifact 2: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Daily Routine and Schedules

## Daily Routine and Schedules

This is **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Schedules**, outlining daily activities for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on mitochondrial health and symptom management. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients** (e.g., lectins, phytates), with no strict dietary restrictions, and incorporates **The Wahls Protocol** principles. It supports digestion, cognitive function, and mobility through meal timing, exercise, and sun exposure, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. Activities are scheduled to minimize cognitive/physical load, with meal prep, exercise, and relaxation integrated for MS needs. Shopping is ordered at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, for delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**. For nutritional standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md).
