# Artifact 10: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking Tools

## Tracking Tools

This is **Artifact 10: Tracking Tools**, detailing methods to monitor nutrient intake and MS symptoms for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on mitochondrial health. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients** (e.g., lectins, phytates), with no strict dietary restrictions, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. It supports **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, and **telomere** maintenance through cofactors (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, biotin, cobalamin, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, copper, manganese, zinc, selenium, potassium) and compounds (genistein, EGCG, curcumin, lipoic acid, acetic acid). Tools include **Cronometer** for nutrient tracking and **MySymptoms** for symptom monitoring, ensuring alignment with MS goals. For menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for routine, see **Artifact 2** (./Article2.md).

### Tracking Tools

#### 1. Cronometer (Nutrient Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Tracks nutrient intake to ensure targets for mitochondrial health and MS support are met.
- **Setup**:
  - Download **Cronometer** (iOS/Android, www.cronometer.com, free version).
  - Input profile: Male, 54 years, 71.8 kg, sedentary (adjust for MS activity level).
  - Log daily meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) from **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md).
- **Key Nutrients to Track**:
  - **Protein**: ~115 g/day (~57.5 g/meal).
  - **Fiber**: ~30–35 g/day (~15–17.5 g/meal).
  - **Potassium**: ~3700–4300 mg/day (~1850–2150 mg/meal).
  - **Calcium**: ~1000–1200 mg/day (~500–600 mg/meal).
  - **Vitamin D**: ~2000–4000 IU/day (~1000–2000 IU/meal, including sun exposure).
  - **Thiamine (B1)**: ~1.5–2.0 mg/day (~0.75–1.0 mg/meal).
  - **Flavonoids**: ~200–500 mg/day (~100–250 mg/meal, estimated via strawberries, green tea, parsley).
  - **Vitamin A**: ~1500–2000 µg RAE/day (~750–1000 µg/meal, monitor to avoid toxicity).
  - **Other Cofactors**: Riboflavin (~1.5–2.0 mg/day), Niacin (~20–30 mg NE/day), Pantothenic Acid (~5–7 mg/day), Pyridoxine (~1.5–2.0 mg/day), Biotin (~30–50 µg/day), Cobalamin (~2.4 µg/day), Phosphorus (~700–1000 mg/day), Magnesium (~350–420 mg/day), Iron (~8.7–12 mg/day), Copper (~1.2–2.0 mg/day), Manganese (~2.3–3.0 mg/day), Zinc (~11 mg/day), Selenium (~75–100 µg/day).
- **Instructions**:
  - Log each meal ingredient (e.g., 4 eggs, 100 g tinned fish, 100 g tofu, 100 g broccoli).
  - Verify nutrient totals daily, adjust portions if deficits occur (e.g., increase lentils for thiamine).
  - Export weekly data for dietitian/neurologist review after 1–2 weeks ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

#### 2. MySymptoms (Symptom Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Monitors MS symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, constipation, cognition) and dietary reactions to guide adjustments.
- **Setup**:
  - Download **MySymptoms** (iOS/Android, www.mysymptoms.net, free version).
  - Create symptom categories: Fatigue, Spasticity, Constipation, Bloating, Cognitive Function, Histamine Reactions, Vitamin A Toxicity.
- **Key Symptoms to Track**:
  - **Fatigue**: Rate 1–10 daily (aim <2), note after meals/exercise.
  - **Spasticity**: Rate 1–10 daily (aim <2), monitor relation to magnesium, flavonoids.
  - **Constipation**: Log stool consistency (Bristol Stool Chart, Type 3–4 ideal), frequency (aim daily).
  - **Bloating**: Rate 1–10 after meals (aim <2), note with lentils, milk, or strawberries.
  - **Cognitive Function**: Rate brain fog 1–10 daily (aim <2), assess impact of eggs, flavonoids.
  - **Histamine Reactions**: Log flushing, itching 1–10 (aim <2), monitor fish, milk.
  - **Vitamin A Toxicity**: Log nausea, headache 1–10 (aim <2), monitor squash, parsley.
- **Instructions**:
  - Log symptoms 2x/day (post-lunch, bedtime).
  - Correlate with **Cronometer** data (e.g., bloating with lentils, fatigue with thiamine deficit).
  - Adjust foods if symptoms >2 (e.g., reduce lentils to 50 g/meal, parsley to 5 g/meal).
  - Share data with dietitian/neurologist after 1–2 weeks.

### Notes
- **Integration**: Use **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms** together to link nutrient intake and symptoms ([Article1.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact1.md)).
- **Adjustments**: If thiamine <1.5 mg/day, increase nutritional yeast to 10 g/meal; if vitamin A >2000 µg RAE/day, reduce squash ([Article9.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact9.md)).
- **Accessibility**: Apps simplify tracking for MS cognitive needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
