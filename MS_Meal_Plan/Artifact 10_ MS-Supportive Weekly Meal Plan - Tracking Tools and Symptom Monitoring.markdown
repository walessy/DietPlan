# Artifact 10: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking Tools and Symptom Monitoring

## Overview

This is **Artifact 10: Tracking Tools and Symptom Monitoring**, providing guidance on using tools to monitor nutrient intake and symptoms for the 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, with weaker digestive motility impacting gut function. The plan adheres to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated by reducing intake and adding tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), neuropathy from apples/cocoa (excluded), and the use of whole chickens (2 x 1.45 kg) for bone broth. The menu, based on **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md), delivers ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, with ~30–35 g fiber/day, ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables, and ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day. This artifact details the use of **Cronometer** for nutrient tracking and **MySymptoms** for symptom monitoring to optimize digestion, sleep, and MS management, with shopping ordered online at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, and delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**. For routine, see **Artifact 2** (./Article2.md); for menu, see **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for AIP, see **Artifact 13** (./Article13.md).

### Importance of Tracking in MS

- **Nutrient Monitoring**: Ensures targets (protein, leucine, fiber, potassium, choline) are met, supporting muscle preservation, nerve health, and digestion ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Symptom Tracking**: Identifies correlations between diet and symptoms (e.g., constipation, sleep, neuropathy), enabling adjustments to improve MS outcomes ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **User Context**: Weaker digestion requires close monitoring to address constipation, bloating, and ensure gut-supportive foods (e.g., bone broth, avocados) are effective ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

### Tracking Tools

#### Cronometer (Nutrient Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Tracks macronutrients (protein, leucine), micronutrients (potassium, choline), and fiber to meet plan targets.
- **Setup**:
  - Download: Available on iOS/Android or web (https://cronometer.com/).
  - Account: Create free account, input profile (male, 54 years, 71.8 kg, MS-specific goals).
  - Settings: Set targets: protein (~115 g/day), fiber (~30–35 g/day), potassium (~3,700–4,300 mg/day), choline (~500–625 mg/day).
- **Usage**:
  - Log daily meals from **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md) (e.g., 4 eggs, 100 g tinned fish, 200 g zucchini).
  - Input leucine manually (e.g., eggs ~0.5–0.6 g/egg, tinned fish ~1.8–2.0 g/100 g) using **Artifact 7** (./Article7.md).
  - Review: Check daily totals against targets, adjust portions if needed (e.g., increase avocado for fiber).
- **Compatibility**: Supports low-histamine, low-FODMAP, AIP-compliant foods; user-friendly for MS cognitive needs ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).

#### MySymptoms (Symptom Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Monitors MS and digestive symptoms to correlate with diet, guiding adjustments.
- **Setup**:
  - Download: Available on iOS/Android (https://mysymptoms.net/).
  - Account: Create account, input MS-specific symptoms (e.g., constipation, sleep quality, neuropathy).
  - Settings: Use Bristol Stool Chart for constipation, 1–10 scales for sleep, neuropathy, bloating, fatigue.
- **Usage**:
  - Log daily: Record meals (from **Cronometer**), symptoms (post-meal, daily), and activities (e.g., yoga, fasting) ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
  - Key Symptoms:
    - **Constipation**: Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Chart, Type 3–4 ideal) post-avocado, pear, bone broth.
    - **Sleep**: Hours, quality (1–10 scale) post-eggs, blueberries, magnesium citrate.
    - **Neuropathy**: Tingling (1–10 scale) post-blueberries.
    - **Bloating**: Discomfort (1–10 scale) post-avocado, yogurt.
    - **Inflammation**: Fatigue, spasticity (1–10 scale) post-liver, fasting.
  - Review: Analyze trends (e.g., bloating after yogurt), generate reports for dietitian/neurologist.
- **Compatibility**: Customizable for MS symptoms, supports digestive tracking ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

### Monitoring Guidelines

#### Nutrient Targets
- **Protein**: ~115 g/day (~57.5 g/meal), ensuring ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md)).
- **Fiber**: ~30–35 g/day (~15–17.5 g/meal) to support digestion ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
- **Potassium**: ~3,700–4,300 mg/day (~1850–2150 mg/meal) for nerve function ([Article1.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact1.md)).
- **Choline**: ~500–625 mg/day for nerve health, sleep ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
- **Action**: Log in **Cronometer** daily, verify totals, adjust portions (e.g., add zucchini for potassium).

#### Symptom Monitoring
- **Constipation**: Track stool consistency daily, aim for Type 3–4 (Bristol Stool Chart). Correlate with avocado, pear, bone broth intake.
- **Sleep**: Log hours, quality nightly, target 7–8 hours, 7–10 quality. Correlate with eggs, blueberries, magnesium citrate.
- **Neuropathy**: Monitor tingling post-blueberries, target 0–2 on 1–10 scale.
- **Bloating**: Track discomfort post-meals, target 0–2. Correlate with avocado, yogurt.
- **Inflammation**: Monitor fatigue, spasticity daily, target 0–2. Correlate with liver, fasting.
- **Action**: Log in **MySymptoms** post-meals, daily, note trends for adjustments.

### Adjustments Based on Tracking

- **Nutrient Shortfalls**:
  - **Protein/Leucine**: If <115 g/day, increase chicken to 125 g/serving ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md)).
  - **Fiber**: If <30 g/day, increase avocado to 50 g/serving, pear to 100 g/serving ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
  - **Potassium**: If <3,700 mg/day, add zucchini (250 g/meal) ([Article1.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact1.md)).
  - **Choline**: If <500 mg/day, ensure 5 eggs/day ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
- **Symptom Adjustments**:
  - **Constipation**: Increase avocado (50 g), pear (100 g), or magnesium citrate (400 mg) if Bristol Type 1–2 persists ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
  - **Sleep**: Add blueberries (75 g) to Monday/Thursday dinner, increase magnesium citrate (400 mg) if quality <7 ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
  - **Neuropathy**: Reduce blueberries to 50 g (~12.3 mg oxalates) if tingling >2 ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
  - **Bloating**: Reduce avocado to 20 g, discontinue yogurt, substitute pear if discomfort >2 ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
  - **Inflammation**: Increase liver to 75 g/serving (once/week), extend yoga (10 min) if fatigue/spasticity >2 ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Consult**: Share **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms** reports with dietitian/neurologist after 1–2 weeks ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **SuperGrok**: Query for tracking optimization (e.g., “MS symptom tracking tools”) or digestion support (e.g., “Low-FODMAP foods for constipation”). Available via **SuperGrok** subscription on grok.com (visit https://x.ai/grok for pricing).

### Notes

- **Integration**: Tracking supports adjustments to menu (**Artifact 15**), routine (**Artifact 2**), and supplements (**Artifact 4**) for digestion and MS management ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **Digestive Support**: Bone broth, avocados, pear, and yogurt address weaker motility, monitored for constipation relief ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Whole Chickens**: Two 1.45 kg chickens provide meat (~1100 g) and bone broth (~2000 ml) ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **AIP Compliance**: Nightshade-free, includes liver, yogurt ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Accessibility**: Simple tracking tools accommodate MS cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
