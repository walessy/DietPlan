# Artifact 10: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Tracking Tools and Symptom Monitoring

## Tracking Tools and Symptom Monitoring

This is **Artifact 10: Tracking Tools and Symptom Monitoring**, providing methods to monitor nutrient intake, symptoms, and adherence to the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg. The plan aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and incorporates **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated with tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), and neuropathy from apples/cocoa (excluded). The menu reduces chicken (~100 g/meal) and kale (~25 g/serving), adding tinned fish (100 g/serving, 3 times/week), avocados (30 g/serving, 3 times/week), blueberries (75 g/serving, 3 times/week), tart cherries (45 g/serving, 3 times/week), and pear (50 g/serving, 1 time/week) to support gut health and constipation relief ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)). This artifact details tools (**Cronometer**, **MySymptoms**, manual logs) to track nutrients (~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal, ~30–35 g fiber/day, ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables, ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day) and symptoms (constipation, sleep, neuropathy, bloating), ensuring plan optimization for MS management.

### Tracking Objectives
- **Nutrient Intake**: Ensure ~115 g protein/day, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal, ~30–35 g fiber/day, ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables, ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day, ~500–625 mg choline/day to support MS, gut health, and mTOR activation ([Article1.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact1.md)).
- **Symptom Monitoring**: Track constipation (post-tinned fish, avocado, pear), sleep (post-eggs, tart cherries), neuropathy (post-blueberries, tart cherries), bloating (post-avocado, yogurt), and alertness to assess plan efficacy ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
- **Plan Adherence**: Monitor meal timing (12 PM, 7:30–8:00 PM), fasting (16:8), exercise (12:30 PM, 8:00–8:30 PM), and cooking (fresh, immediate consumption) to maintain low-histamine compliance ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
- **Adjustments**: Use data to adjust foods (e.g., reduce tinned fish if histamine issues), supplements (e.g., increase magnesium citrate for sleep), or fasting (e.g., shorten to 14:10 if fatigued) ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md), [Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).

### Recommended Tracking Tools

#### Cronometer (Nutrient Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Tracks macronutrients (protein, fat, fiber), micronutrients (potassium, choline), and leucine to meet nutritional standards ([Article1.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact1.md)).
- **Setup**:
  - Download: Available on iOS/Android or web (https://cronometer.com/, free basic version, ~£49.99/year for premium).
  - Profile: Set weight (71.8 kg), age (54), male, activity level (sedentary, adjust for exercise), and custom targets (115 g protein, 120–150 g fat, 30–35 g fiber, 3700–4300 mg potassium, 500–625 mg choline).
  - Foods: Input daily meals from **Article3.md** (e.g., 100 g tinned fish, 4 eggs, 150 g zucchini, 45 g tart cherries), using USDA database or manual entry for leucine (~1.8–2.0 g/100 g tinned fish, ~0.5–0.6 g/egg, ~2.0–2.3 g/100 g chicken).
- **Usage**:
  - Log meals daily (12 PM, 7:30–8:00 PM), including supplements (e.g., magnesium citrate 200–400 mg).
  - Monitor: Protein (~57.5 g/meal), leucine (~2.5–3.5 g/meal), fiber (~15–17.5 g/meal), potassium (~1850–2150 mg/meal), choline (~250–312.5 mg/meal).
  - Export weekly reports to share with dietitian ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Adjustments**:
  - **Low Protein/Leucine**: Increase eggs to 5/meal or tinned fish to 150 g if below targets ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md)).
  - **Low Fiber**: Add pear (50 g, ~1.5 g fiber) or avocado (50 g, ~3.5 g fiber) to meals ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
- **Accessibility**: Simple interface, customizable for MS cognitive needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).

#### MySymptoms (Symptom Tracking)
- **Purpose**: Monitors constipation, sleep, neuropathy, bloating, and alertness to assess dietary and lifestyle impacts ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md]).
- **Setup**:
  - Download: Available on iOS/Android (https://mysymptoms.net/, ~£4.99 one-time or subscription).
  - Profile: Add symptoms (constipation, sleep quality, neuropathy, bloating, alertness), triggers (foods, fasting, exercise), and metrics (stool consistency, sleep hours).
- **Usage**:
  - **Constipation**: Log post-tinned fish, avocado, pear meals using Bristol Stool Chart (Type 1–2: constipation, Type 3–4: ideal). Note frequency, severity (1–10 scale).
  - **Sleep**: Log hours slept, awakenings, quality (1–10 scale) post-eggs (4–5/meal), tart cherries (45 g, Tuesday/Thursday/Sunday dinner), magnesium citrate (200–400 mg) ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md]).
  - **Neuropathy**: Log tingling (1–10 scale) post-blueberries (75 g, Wednesday/Friday/Saturday), tart cherries (45 g), noting duration and triggers ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md]).
  - **Bloating**: Log discomfort (1–10 scale) post-avocado (30 g), yogurt (1 tbsp, Tuesday/Thursday lunch), blueberries, tart cherries ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md]).
  - **Alertness**: Log energy (1–10 scale) post-eggs, tinned fish, noting cognitive clarity ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md]).
  - Export reports weekly for dietitian/neurologist review.
- **Adjustments**:
  - **Constipation**: If Type 1–2 persists, increase avocado to 50 g/serving, pear to 100 g/serving, or magnesium citrate to 400 mg ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md]).
  - **Poor Sleep**: Add tart cherries (30 g) to Monday/Wednesday dinner, increase magnesium citrate to 400 mg ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md]).
  - **Neuropathy**: Reduce blueberries to 50 g, tart cherries to 30 g if tingling worsens ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md]).
  - **Bloating**: Reduce avocado to 20 g/serving, discontinue yogurt, substitute pear (~50 g, low-FODMAP) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/), [Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md]).
- **Accessibility**: Intuitive app, supports voice input for MS physical limitations ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).

#### Manual Logs (Spreadsheet or Notebook)
- **Purpose**: Backup for nutrient and symptom tracking, especially if digital tools are inaccessible.
- **Setup**:
  - Create a spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets, Excel) or notebook with columns: Date, Meal Time, Foods (quantities), Protein (g), Leucine (g), Fiber (g), Potassium (mg), Choline (mg), Symptoms (constipation, sleep, neuropathy, bloating, alertness), Notes.
  - Reference **Article3.md** for meal details, **Article6.md** for food data (e.g., tinned fish ~25 g protein/100 g, zucchini ~1.5 g fiber/150 g).
- **Usage**:
  - Log meals (12 PM, 7:30–8:00 PM), supplements, and symptoms daily.
  - Summarize weekly: Total protein (~805 g), leucine (~35–49 g), fiber (~210–245 g), potassium (~25,900–30,100 mg), symptom trends.
  - Share with dietitian/neurologist for manual review ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Adjustments**: Same as **Cronometer** and **MySymptoms**, based on nutrient/symptom trends.
- **Accessibility**: Simple format, customizable for MS cognitive needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).

### Monitoring Guidelines
- **Daily**:
  - Log meals/supplements in **Cronometer** to verify nutrient targets.
  - Record symptoms in **MySymptoms** post-meals (e.g., 1–2 hours after tinned fish, avocado).
  - Note adherence to fasting (8 PM–12 PM), exercise (12:30 PM, 8:00–8:30 PM), and cooking (fresh, immediate consumption) ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md]).
- **Weekly**:
  - Review **Cronometer** reports for nutrient totals (protein, leucine, fiber, potassium, choline).
  - Analyze **MySymptoms** trends (e.g., improved stool consistency post-pear, better sleep post-eggs).
  - Adjust plan using **Article9.md** template (e.g., swap tinned fish for salmon if histamine issues) ([Article9.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact9.md]).
- **Consultation**: Share data with dietitian/neurologist after 1–2 weeks to refine foods, supplements, or fasting ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **SuperGrok**: Query for tracking tips (e.g., “How to track constipation in MS diet”) or nutrient adjustments (e.g., “Increase fiber in low-FODMAP MS plan”). Available via **SuperGrok** subscription on grok.com (visit https://x.ai/grok for pricing).

### Notes
- **Synergies**: Tracking supports constipation relief (tinned fish, avocados, pear), sleep (eggs, tart cherries), and neuropathy prevention (no apples/cocoa), aligning with **Article3.md** and **Article6.md**.
- **AIP Compliance**: Monitors AIP foods (liver, yogurt, nightshade-free) and symptoms, per **Article13.md** ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md]).
- **Flavonoid Tracking**: Log blueberry/tart cherry effects (gut health, sleep) to optimize flavonoid benefits, monitoring oxalates (~18.5 mg/75 g blueberries, ~4.5–6.75 mg/45 g cherries) ([News-Medical, 2025](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250326/Flavonoids-help-regulate-gut-hormones-and-show-promise-in-managing-type-2-diabetes.aspx)).
- **Accessibility**: Tools and manual logs are user-friendly, accommodating MS cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/]).
- **Constipation Focus**: Bristol Stool Chart tracking ensures fiber (~30–35 g/day) and magnesium citrate (200–400 mg) address chicken/kale-related issues ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md]).
