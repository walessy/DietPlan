   - Outlines the plan’s purpose, nutritional standards, and mitochondrial health focus, including cofactors for ADP/ATP and NAD/NADH cycles.

2. **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Schedules** ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md))  
   - Provides daily schedules integrating meal prep, exercise, yoga, and sun exposure for vitamin D.

3. **Artifact 3: Detailed Weekly Menu** ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md))  
   - Details the weekly menu with portion sizes and nutrient contributions.
