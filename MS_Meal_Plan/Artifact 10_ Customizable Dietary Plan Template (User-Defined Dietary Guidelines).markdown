# Artifact 10: Customizable Dietary Plan Template

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 10: Customizable Dietary Plan Template**, a user-friendly template for creating a personalized dietary plan adhering to [USER_DIETARY_CONSTRAINTS, e.g., Low-Histamine, Gluten-Free, Oxalate-Free] guidelines. Designed for [USER_PROFILE, e.g., 54-year-old male, 63.5 kg, MS], this template supports a [PLAN_DURATION, e.g., 7-day] meal plan with a budget of [BUDGET, e.g., £60–£80]. Users can customize sections using **keywords** to define dietary goals, nutrient targets, and preferences, ensuring compliance with [DIETARY_GUIDELINES, e.g., Wahls Protocol, Low-FODMAP]. User observations highlight eggs (2–4/day, ~250–500 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, while chicken may cause constipation (mitigated by fiber, e.g., zucchini), and apples/cocoa trigger brain fog and neuropathy due to oxalates and stimulants. For guidance, see **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards** (./Article1.md); for usage instructions, see **Artifact 11: Guide to Using the Customizable Dietary Plan Template** (./Article11.md).
