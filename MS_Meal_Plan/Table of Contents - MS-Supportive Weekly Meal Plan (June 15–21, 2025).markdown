# Table of Contents

This is the Table of Contents for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.7 kg, adhering to low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free (<10 mg/100g), low-FODMAP, leaky gut, and MS-supportive constraints, aligned with The Wahls Protocol (Wahls Paleo level). The artifacts provide comprehensive guidance, including nutritional standards, menu, shopping list, exercise routines, customizable templates, and Autoimmune Protocol (AIP) integration, updated with user observations (e.g., 6 eggs improve alertness and sleep, chicken causes hard stools mitigated with fiber, apples/cocoa worsen neuropathy). The plan emphasizes ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal to activate mTOR, supported by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) after lunch (12:30 PM) and dinner (8:00–8:30 PM) to enhance muscle protein synthesis and nerve health. AIP elements (e.g., organ meats, fermented foods, stress management) reduce inflammation and support gut health. Each artifact includes its own references for self-contained credibility.
