# Table of Contents

This is the Table of Contents for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS, adhering to low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP, leaky gut, and MS-supportive constraints, aligned with The Wahls Protocol. The artifacts provide detailed guidance, including a customizable template and usage guide, updated with user observations (e.g., eggs improve alertness and sleep, chicken causes hard stools, apples/cocoa worsen neuropathy due to oxalates and stimulants). Save this file as `ToC.md` in the same directory as `Article1.md` through `Article11.md` (e.g., `MS_Meal_Plan`) to ensure links work correctly.

### Instructions for Saving and Downloading ToC.md
1. **Save ToC.md**:
   - Copy the content within the `<xaiArtifact>` tag above (from ```yaml to ```).
   - Paste into a text editor (e.g., Notepad, VS Code).
   - Save as `ToC.md` in the `MS_Meal_Plan` folder, overwriting the existing `ToC.md` to update it.
   - Ensure the `.md` extension is used.

2. **Verify File**:
   - Open `ToC.md` in a Markdown reader (e.g., Markdown Reader, https://markdownreader.github.io/) or editor (e.g., Obsidian, Typora).
   - Check that all links (`./Article1.md` through `./Article11.md`) are listed and will resolve once corresponding files are updated.

3. **Folder Structure**:
   - Ensure `MS_Meal_Plan` folder contains `ToC.md` and placeholders for `Article1.md` through `Article11.md` (to be updated as requested).

### Next Steps
I’ve provided the updated `ToC.md` as the first separate artifact, aligning with your request to start with individual articles. Please confirm the following to proceed:

- **Confirm ToC.md**: Verify if the updated `ToC.md` is suitable, or specify any changes needed.
- **Request Next Artifact**: Indicate which artifact to update next (e.g., “Provide updated Article1.md”), and I’ll deliver it as a separate `<xaiArtifact>` block with your dietary observations, relative paths, and accessibility features.
- **File Compilation**:
  - If you want a **Python script** to combine `ToC.md` and `Article1.md` through `Article11.md` into a single Markdown document once all are updated, confirm your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
  - If you prefer a **PDF via LaTeX**, confirm if you can handle LaTeX source (I’ll provide a `.tex` file) or need a structure for external compilation (e.g., Overleaf instructions).
- **Additional Requests**:
  - If you need further dietary adjustments (e.g., a temporary egg-focused plan to avoid chicken), symptom tracking tools, or specific updates to artifacts, please specify.
  - If you need help with the `MS_Meal_Plan` folder, TOC links, or zipping, confirm your OS for tailored guidance.
- **Symptom Follow-Up**: If your digestive discomfort, brain fog, or neuropathy persists, please share updates for tailored dietary recommendations.

Thank you for your clear direction. Please confirm `ToC.md`’s suitability, request the next artifact (e.g., “Provide updated Article1.md”), and specify any additional needs to support your health and project goals!
