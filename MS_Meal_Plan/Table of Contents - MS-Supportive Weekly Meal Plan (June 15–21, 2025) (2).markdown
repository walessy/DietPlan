# Table of Contents

This is the Table of Contents for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.7 kg, adhering to low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP, leaky gut, and MS-supportive constraints, aligned with The Wahls Protocol. The artifacts provide detailed guidance, including a customizable template, usage guide, leucine-focused strategies, and exercise routines, updated with user observations (e.g., eggs improve alertness, chicken causes constipation, apples/cocoa worsen neuropathy). The plan emphasizes ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal to activate mTOR, supported by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) after lunch and dinner. Each artifact includes its own references for self-contained credibility. Save this file as `ToC.md` in the same directory as `Article1.md` through `Article12.md` (e.g., `MS_Meal_Plan`) to ensure links work correctly.
