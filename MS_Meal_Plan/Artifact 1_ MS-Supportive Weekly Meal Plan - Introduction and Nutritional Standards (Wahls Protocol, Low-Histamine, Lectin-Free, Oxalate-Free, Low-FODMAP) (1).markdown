# Artifact 1: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Introduction and Nutritional Standards

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards**, outlining the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.7 kg. The plan aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and incorporates elements of the **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** to support MS management, delivering ~114.7 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.4 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a **16:8 intermittent fasting schedule** (12 PM–8 PM eating window, fasting 8 PM–12 PM, no breakfast). It ensures all 9 essential amino acids (EAAs), Vitamin B12 (~2.5–3.0 µg/day from food, supplemented to ~1000 µg/day), and choline (~500–625 mg/day from 4–5 eggs/day) to support leaky gut, constipation, bowel-bladder issues, neuropathic pain, post-antibiotic gut issues, and MS needs, particularly **neuropathy prevention**. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day) improving alertness and sleep via choline, while chicken may cause hard stools, addressed by increasing fiber (~30–35 g/day, e.g., zucchini) and hydration (3 L/day). Apples and cocoa are excluded due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants causing brain fog, digestive discomfort, and worsened neuropathy. For menu details, see **Artifact 3: Menu** (./Article3.md); for preparation, see **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule** (./Article2.md); for nerve health, see **Artifact 4: Nerve Health Support** (./Article4.md); for AIP integration, see **Artifact 13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration** (./Article13.md). Use Markdown Reader (https://markdownreader.github.io/) to view ([Physiother Res Int., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.2087)).

The plan uses **whole chicken**, **chicken breasts**, **wild Alaskan salmon** (fresh, cooked immediately, no reheating), **eggs**, and **chicken liver** (AIP-aligned) to prevent histamine formation ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)). Bone broth (~2800 ml prepared, 14 x 200 ml, ~2000 ml consumed) from ~1400 g chicken bones is frozen, defrosted daily, and heated once, with excess for losses. It includes ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables (~4.5–6 cups cooked, ~600–800 g, ~2:1 raw-to-cooked ratio for kale, 1:1 for lettuce): ~3 cups greens (kale, butter leaf lettuce, bok choy, sea vegetables), ~3 cups sulfur-rich (cabbage, radishes, garlic), ~3 cups colorful (carrots, celery, blueberries, tart cherries, white potato), all lectin-free (peeled where needed), low-FODMAP, and oxalate-free (<10 mg/100g cooked). Nightshades (e.g., tomatoes, peppers) are excluded to reduce inflammation, per AIP principles ([Article13](https://Article13.md)). **Blueberries** (~50 g/sitting, ~0.5 cup raw, ~12.5 mg oxalates) and **tart cherries** (~30 g/sitting, ~0.3 cup raw, ~3–4.5 mg oxalates) are included, monitored for oxalate/FODMAP sensitivity due to moderate oxalate levels ([The Wahls Protocol, 2020](https://terrywahls.com/), [www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)). Apples and cocoa are avoided due to digestive and neurological adverse effects ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)). For food compatibility, see **Artifact 6: Non-Plan Content** (./Article6.md).

New foods include **chicken liver** (~100 g/week, ~50 g/serving, AIP-aligned for B vitamins), **coconut yogurt** (~100 ml/week, ~1 tbsp/serving, for gut health), **celery** (~50 g/sitting), **wild Alaskan salmon** (~100 g/sitting), **garlic** (~5 g/sitting), **blueberries** (~50 g/sitting), **tart cherries** (~30 g/sitting), **sea vegetables** (~20 g/sitting), and increased **eggs** (~4–5/day), replacing cucumber, apple, and some chicken to reduce constipation risk and boost leucine (~2.0–3.0 g/day from eggs). Incompatible foods (beetroot, shiitake mushrooms, green tea, almond butter, pumpkin seeds, whey protein, apples, cocoa, nightshades) are excluded due to oxalate, FODMAP, lectin, histamine, or dairy issues ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/), [www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)). For exclusion rationale, see **Artifact 6** (./Article6.md). **Plenish Spirulina Detox** (~30 ml/day) adds antioxidants ([Front Nutr., 2020](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2020.00132/full)). **Supplements** (R-ALA, Benfotiamine, P5P, Methylcobalamin, 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate, L-Citrulline, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, Creatine, magnesium citrate) address nerve health, as foods can’t provide therapeutic doses except folate (~223–429 µg/day, supplemented) and choline (~500–625 mg/day from eggs) ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)). Magnesium citrate (~200–400 mg/day, dinner) enhances deep sleep and bowel regularity ([Nutrients, 2017](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/7/767)).

The plan provides ~340–390 mg magnesium/day from diet, supplemented with ~200–400 mg/day magnesium citrate, ~80–200 µg iodine/day (seaweed), ~30–35 g/day fiber (increased for constipation), and ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day, supporting MS and neuropathy prevention ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)). Some nutrients (calcium, Vitamin D, omega-3s, iodine) are below RDA/AI, mitigated by salmon, liver, and monitoring ([Neurology, 2018](https://n.neurology.org/content/90/20/e1859)). It adheres to low-histamine, lectin-free, low-FODMAP, gluten-free, dairy-free, **Healthy Keto/AIP-like** principles, with a budget of ~£63.62–£65.29 (excluding supplements), slightly above the original ~£56–£59 due to salmon, blueberries, tart cherries, eggs, liver, yogurt, and magnesium citrate (see **Artifact 5: Shopping List** (./Article5.md)). For post-meal exercise, see **Artifact 12: Post-Meal Exercise Routine** (./Article12.md). Shopping occurs Thursday, June 12, 2025.
