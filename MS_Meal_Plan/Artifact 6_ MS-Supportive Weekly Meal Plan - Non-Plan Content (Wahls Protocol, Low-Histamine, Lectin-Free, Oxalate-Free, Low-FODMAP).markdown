# Artifact 6: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Non-Plan Content

## Non-Plan Content

This is **Artifact 6: Non-Plan Content**, providing rationale for food inclusions and exclusions in the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and incorporating **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles. The plan delivers ~115 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, targeting ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mTOR activation, enhanced by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) at 12:30 PM and 8:00–8:30 PM ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)). User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated with tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), and neuropathy from apples/cocoa. The updated menu reduces chicken (~100 g/meal) and kale (~25 g/serving), adding tinned fish (100 g/serving, 3 times/week), avocados (30 g/serving, 3 times/week), blueberries (75 g/serving, 3 times/week), tart cherries (45 g/serving, 3 times/week), and pear (50 g/serving, 1 time/week) to improve gut health and align with flavonoid benefits ([News-Medical, 2025](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250326/Flavonoids-help-regulate-gut-hormones-and-show-promise-in-managing-type-2-diabetes.aspx)). This artifact explains the compatibility of included foods and exclusion of incompatible ones, ensuring MS and gut health support.

### Excluded Foods and Rationale

#### High-Oxalate Foods
- **Apples (~20–30 mg/182 g)**: Excluded due to user-reported neuropathy, linked to oxalates and fructose (high-FODMAP), exacerbating MS symptoms ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/), [www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Cocoa (~600–700 mg/100 g)**: High oxalates and theobromine (stimulant) worsen neuropathy and brain fog ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **Beetroot (~20–30 mg/100 g)**: High oxalates irritate nerves, not low-FODMAP ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).

#### High-Histamine Foods
- **Shiitake Mushrooms**: Fermented histamine content unsuitable for low-histamine diet ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Aged Cheeses, Fermented Foods (non-AIP)**: High histamine risks gut irritation and MS flare-ups ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).

#### Lectin-Containing Foods
- **Legumes, Nightshades (e.g., Tomatoes, Peppers)**: Lectins disrupt gut barrier, exacerbating leaky gut and MS inflammation ([Front Plant Sci., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.01365/full)). Nightshades excluded due to alkaloids (e.g., solanine), worsening neuropathy, per AIP principles ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888), [Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).

#### High-FODMAP Foods
- **Green Tea**: Contains catechins and FODMAPs, may cause digestive discomfort ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Onions, Garlic (large amounts)**: High-FODMAP, avoided except in small doses (garlic ~5 g/serving) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).

#### Dairy and Allergenic Foods
- **Almond Butter, Pumpkin Seeds**: Potential allergens, lectins, and oxalates (~100–200 mg/100 g) risk neuropathy ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **Whey Protein**: Dairy-based, high-histamine, causes gut irritation and MS flare-ups ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).

### Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Track Symptoms**: Use **MySymptoms** or **Cronometer** to log:
  - **Constipation**: Stool consistency (post-fish, avocado, pear) using Bristol Stool Chart ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
  - **Neuropathy**: Tingling post-blueberries/tart cherries (moderate oxalates).
  - **Histamine**: Flushing post-tinned fish.
  - **Bloating**: Discomfort post-avocado/yogurt/cherries ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
  - **Sleep**: Improvements post-eggs or liver meals ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
- **Adjustments**:
  - **Constipation**: Increase avocado to 50 g/serving or pear to 100 g/serving if persistent, reduce chicken to 50 g/meal ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
  - **Neuropathy**: Reduce blueberries to 50 g, tart cherries to 30 g if tingling worsens, consult neurologist ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888)).
  - **Histamine**: Reduce tinned fish to 50 g/serving or switch to fresh salmon if flushing occurs ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
  - **Bloating**: Discontinue yogurt or reduce avocado to 20 g/serving, substitute pear (~50 g, low-FODMAP) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/), [Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Consult Experts**: Share logs with a dietitian or neurologist to validate food compatibility, especially for MS-specific symptoms ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Use SuperGrok**: Query for compatible substitutes (e.g., “Low-oxalate, low-FODMAP fruit for MS”) or symptom tracking tips. Available via **SuperGrok** subscription on grok.com (visit https://x.ai/grok for pricing) ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
