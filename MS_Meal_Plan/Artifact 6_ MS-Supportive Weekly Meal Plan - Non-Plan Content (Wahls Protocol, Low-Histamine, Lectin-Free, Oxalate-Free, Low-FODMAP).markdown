# Artifact 6: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Non-Plan Content

## Non-Plan Content

This is **Artifact 6: Non-Plan Content**, providing rationale for food inclusions and exclusions in the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.7 kg, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level). The plan delivers ~114.7 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.4 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, targeting ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mTOR activation, enhanced by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) after lunch (12:30 PM) and dinner (8:00–8:30 PM) to support muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and nerve health ([Article2: Daily Routine](./Article2.md), [Article11: Leucine and mTOR Activation Guidance](./Article11.md)). User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, while chicken may cause hard stools, mitigated with ~30–35 g/day fiber (e.g., zucchini) and 3 L/day water. Apples and cocoa are excluded due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants worsening neuropathy and brain fog. This artifact explains the compatibility of included foods (e.g., eggs, salmon, blueberries) and the exclusion of incompatible foods (e.g., apples, cocoa, whey), ensuring alignment with MS management and dietary constraints.

- **Butter Leaf Lettuce, Bok Choy, Cabbage, Carrots, Celery, Radishes, White Potato (2600 g/week total)**: Provide ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day, ~12–18 g fiber/day, supporting gut health and MS management ([USDA FoodData Central, 2018](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)). All are **low-histamine**, **lectin-free** (peeled where needed), **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut/MS-supportive** ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).

### Excluded Foods and Rationale

#### High-Oxalate Foods
- **Apples (~20–30 mg/182 g)**: Excluded due to user-reported neuropathy and brain fog, linked to oxalates and fructose (high-FODMAP), which may exacerbate MS symptoms ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/), [www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Cocoa (~600–700 mg/100 g)**: Excluded due to high oxalates and theobromine (stimulant), worsening neuropathy and brain fog ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **Beetroot (~20–30 mg/100 g)**: High oxalates may irritate nerves, not low-FODMAP ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).

#### High-Histamine Foods
- **Shiitake Mushrooms**: Fermented histamine content unsuitable for low-histamine diet ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Aged Cheeses, Fermented Foods**: High histamine risks gut irritation and MS symptom flare-ups ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).

#### Lectin-Containing Foods
- **Legumes, Nightshades (e.g., Tomatoes)**: Lectins may disrupt gut barrier, exacerbating leaky gut and MS inflammation ([Front Plant Sci., 2017](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.01365/full)).

#### High-FODMAP Foods
- **Green Tea**: Contains catechins and FODMAPs, may cause digestive discomfort ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Onions, Garlic (large amounts)**: High-FODMAP, avoided except in small doses (garlic ~5 g/serving) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).

#### Dairy and Allergenic Foods
- **Almond Butter, Pumpkin Seeds**: Excluded due to potential allergens, lectins, and oxalates (~100–200 mg/100 g), risking neuropathy ([www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **Whey Protein**: Dairy-based, high-histamine, may cause gut irritation and MS flare-ups ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).

### Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Track Symptoms**: Use **MySymptoms** or spreadsheets to log:
  - **Neuropathy/Brain Fog**: Post-blueberry/tart cherry consumption (moderate oxalates).
  - **Digestive Issues**: Constipation (post-chicken), bloating (post-cherries).
  - **Sleep/Alertness**: Improvements post-egg meals.
- **Adjustments**:
  - **Neuropathy**: If tingling worsens, eliminate blueberries/tart cherries, consult neurologist ([J Neuroimmunol., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165572817301888)).
  - **Constipation**: Increase zucchini to 150 g/sitting (~1.5 g fiber), reduce chicken to 100 g/meal ([Article3: Menu](./Article3.md)).
  - **Bloating**: If cherries cause discomfort, substitute peeled pear (~30 g, low-FODMAP) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Consult Experts**: Share logs with a dietitian to validate food compatibility, especially for MS-specific symptoms ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Use SuperGrok**: Query for compatible food substitutes (e.g., “Low-oxalate, low-FODMAP fruit for MS”) or symptom tracking tips. Available via **SuperGrok** subscription on grok.com (visit https://x.ai/grok for pricing) ([Article10: Guide](./Article10.md)).
