# Artifact 02: Table of Contents - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plans

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 02: Table of Contents - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plans**, providing a comprehensive index of all artifacts related to the 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) designed for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. The project includes two plans: **Plan A** (comprehensive, 18 foods, ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids, ~$141.13–$149.88) and **Plan B** (simplified, 9 foods, ~111 g/day protein, ~10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids, ~$99.63–$112.73 without optionals), both supporting **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). A **MIND diet** variant for Plan A enhances cognitive health. This ToC lists all 28 artifacts, organized by plan, with titles, artifact IDs (where available), tags, and purposes. For an overview of plan development, see **Artifact_01_IntroductionAndDevelopment.md**; for specific plans, see **Artifact_05_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md** and **Artifact_23_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md**.

## Notes
- **Organization**: Artifacts are grouped by plan (Shared, Plan A, Plan B, MIND) for clarity. Shared artifacts apply to all plans, Plan A artifacts focus on the comprehensive plan, Plan B artifacts emphasize simplicity, and the MIND artifact addresses cognitive health. Plan B artifacts are standalone but reference Plan A artifacts (e.g., **Artifact_07**, **Artifact_09**) for shared guidelines, supporting separate handling.
- **Numbering**: Artifacts are numbered sequentially (**Artifact_01** to **Artifact_28**) per the revised system, eliminating **A/B** suffixes and non-sequential prefixes ([message](#message-0c2c9cc9-32ff-468c-a64e-46535e9cf91e)). The sequence prioritizes shared artifacts, followed by Plan A, Plan B, and MIND.
- **Artifact IDs**: Provided where known; others are unspecified but inferred as part of the 28 artifacts based on prior responses ([message](#message-0b4684e4-8b96-46b8-b3a0-4c72e7b7aabd)).
- **Output Artifacts**: **Artifact_01**, **Artifact_06**, **Artifact_23**, **Artifact_24**, and **Artifact_25** were fully output; others were referenced. Artifacts marked as `Draft` (e.g., **Artifact_03**, **Artifact_22**) have not been fully output but are included for completeness.
- **Folder Structure**: This artifact resides in `MS_Meal_Plan/Shared/`, per the approved organization ([message](#message-4b05b1d7-1e02-4c50-a73a-d8d65a0a0c6e]). Other artifacts are in subfolders (e.g., `Plan_A/Standards`, `Plan_B/Menu`).
- **Labeling**: Each artifact includes tags from the approved hybrid labeling strategy (`Plan`, `Purpose`, `Status`), with explicit **Plan A**, **Plan B**, **MIND**, or **Shared** tags per your requirement ([message](#message-0c2c9cc9-32ff-468c-a64e-46535e9cf91e]).
