# Artifact 24: Shopping List - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Simplified)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 24: Shopping List - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Simplified)**, providing a comprehensive shopping list for **Plan B**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan B is a simplified dietary approach using 9 foods to deliver approximately 111 g/day protein, 10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, and 419–839 mg/day flavonoids, supporting **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document lists all ingredients required for Plan B’s 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners), including quantities, estimated costs, and sourcing guidelines to ensure compliance with MS dietary requirements. For the detailed menu, see **Artifact_23_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md**; for nutritional standards, see **Artifact_22_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md**; for customization options, see **Artifact_25_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanB.md**; for Plan A’s shopping list, see **Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**.

- **Quantities**: Calculated for 14 meals (2 meals/day x 7 days), with slight overage (~5–10%) to account for spoilage, preparation losses, or substitutions.
- **Sourcing**: Primary retailer is ASDA for cost efficiency; alternatives include Tesco, Sainsbury’s, or local markets by June 3, 2025, for delivery by June 4, 2025 ([Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md)).

## Sourcing and Storage Guidelines
- **Sourcing**:
  - **Primary Retailer**: Order from asda.com by June 3, 2025, for delivery by June 4, 2025, selecting earliest slot (~$3–$5). Verify SIGHI score 0–1, no additives, and freshness (e.g., firm zucchini) on product pages.
  - **Alternatives**: If unavailable at ASDA, source from Tesco, Sainsbury’s, or local markets; prioritize fresh produce (harvested within 3–5 days) and check labels for compliance ([Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md)).
  - **Verification**: Inspect delivery for quality (e.g., no cracked eggs, undented cans); return spoilage to retailer. Log sourcing issues in **MySymptoms** (e.g., histamine >2 from overripe blueberries).
- **Storage**:
  - **Perishables**: Refrigerate eggs, tinned sardines (post-opening), tofu, avocado, zucchini, kale, blueberries, and oat milk at 35–40°F; consume within 24 hours post-preparation to minimize histamine ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
  - **Non-Perishables**: Store unopened tinned sardines, rice, green tea, and flaxseed oil at room temperature in airtight containers; refrigerate flaxseed oil post-opening.
  - **Tofu**: Store in water (change daily), use within 3 days; discard if odor develops.
  - **Avocado**: Store ripe at 35–40°F, unripe at room temperature (2–3 days); use lemon juice (SIGHI 0) to prevent browning if cut.
- **Monitoring**: Log ingredient quality and storage in **MySymptoms**; track symptoms (1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition/sleep) to ensure sourcing/storage supports MS management ([Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Plan B Focus**: This artifact provides a streamlined shopping list for Plan B’s 9-food menu, requiring fewer items than Plan A’s 32-ingredient list, ideal for cost and simplicity ([Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: All ingredients meet **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** standards, minimizing MS symptom triggers ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Budget**: List aligns with Plan B’s budget (~$99.63–$112.76 without optionals), significantly lower than Plan A (~$141.13–$149.88) due to fewer ingredients ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Ingredients support the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals with flavonoid-rich blueberries and green tea ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
- **Usability**: Simplified list and sourcing make Plan B accessible for MS patients with energy or cognitive constraints.
- **ZIP Request**: Your prior request for a ZIP file for Windows ([message](#message-4327a6b3-0da6-4db9-95c3-b99b88abf635]) included **Artifact_24** as a fully output artifact. This output confirms the content. Confirm if an updated ZIP or alternative delivery (e.g., cloud link) is needed.
