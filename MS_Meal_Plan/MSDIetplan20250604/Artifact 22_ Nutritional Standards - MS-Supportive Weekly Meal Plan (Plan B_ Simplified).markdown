# Artifact 22: Nutritional Standards - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Simplified)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 22: Nutritional Standards - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Simplified)**, outlining the nutritional standards for **Plan B**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan B is a simplified dietary approach with 9 foods, delivering ~111 g/day protein, ~10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, and ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids to support **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document defines the macro- and micronutrient targets, bioactive compound goals, and dietary constraints for Plan B’s 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners), ensuring compatibility with MS management.

## Nutritional Standards Overview

- **Purpose**: To establish nutrient targets for Plan B to optimize MS symptom management (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, neuropathy, bloating, histamine reactions) through a simplified, cost-effective diet (~$99.63–$112.73 without optionals) compared to Plan A (~$141.13–$149.88).
- **Foods**: 9 core ingredients (eggs, tinned sardines, tofu, avocado, zucchini, kale, blueberries, fortified oat milk, green tea) and 4 optional substitutes (rice, spinach, cauliflower, flaxseed oil), selected for **low-histamine** (SIGHI score 0–1), **low-oxalate** (<10 mg/100 g), and **low-antinutrient** properties ([Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **Nutrient Goals**:
  - Deliver ~55.5 g protein, ~5.2–6.0 g leucine, ~209.5–419.5 mg flavonoids per meal to support muscle maintenance, cognitive health, and inflammation reduction.
  - Ensure adequate micronutrients (e.g., calcium, potassium, vitamin D) to support nerve function, bone health, and immune modulation.
- **Constraints**:
  - Adhere to **low-histamine** (SIGHI score 0–1, <1 mg/100 g), **low-oxalate** (<10 mg/100 g), and **low-antinutrient** (e.g., minimal phytates/lectins) standards to minimize symptom triggers ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
  - Maintain a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule (12:00 PM–8:00 PM eating window) for circadian alignment ([Artifact_15_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_15_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Use **Cronometer** to track nutrients and **MySymptoms** to monitor symptoms (1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition/sleep) to verify adherence and efficacy ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).

## Nutritional Targets

### Macronutrients
- **Protein**:
  - **Target**: ~111 g/day (~1.55 g/kg body weight), ~55.5 g/meal.

  - **Sources**: Tinned sardines (100 g/meal, ~1–2 g), optional flaxseed oil (15 ml, ~2 g ALA).

### Dietary Constraints
- **Low-Histamine**:
  - All foods must have SIGHI score 0–1 (<1 mg/100 g histamine); store at 35–40°F, consume within 24 hours post-preparation to prevent histamine accumulation ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
  - Examples: Fresh eggs (SIGHI 0), tinned sardines in water (SIGHI 0), fresh blueberries (SIGHI 0).
- **Low-Oxalate**:
  - Oxalate content <10 mg/100 g to minimize kidney and neurological stress ([The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
  - Examples: Zucchini (~2 mg/100 g), blueberries (~1 mg/100 g), avocado (~0 mg/100 g).
- **Low-Antinutrient**:
  - Minimize phytates, lectins, and oxalates through preparation (e.g., soak quinoa overnight, steam kale 5–7 min) to enhance nutrient absorption.
  - Examples: Soaked quinoa (reduced phytates), steamed tofu (reduced phytates).
- **Circadian Alignment**:
  - Meals timed at 12:00 PM (lunch) and 7:30–8:00 PM (dinner) within a 16:8 fasting schedule to support **ADP/ATP**, **NAD/NADH**, and **FAD/FADH2 cycles** ([Chronobiol Int., 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7511788/)).
- **Allergen Avoidance**:
  - Exclude apples, cocoa, and meat per user preferences; avoid common allergens (e.g., soy additives, gluten) to minimize histamine reactions.

## Monitoring and Verification
- **Tools**:
  - **Cronometer**: Log meals daily (post-lunch 12:30 PM, post-dinner 8:00 PM) to verify macro- and micronutrient targets (e.g., ~55.5 g protein/meal, ~900–1020 mg calcium/meal) ([Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md)).
  - **MySymptoms**: Track symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, neuropathy, bloating, histamine) daily (1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition/sleep) to assess dietary impact ([Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md)).
- **Verification**:
  - **Weekly Review**: By July 1, 2025, analyze Cronometer data to confirm nutrient targets; adjust portions (e.g., increase sardines to 150 g/meal if protein <111 g/day) or add supplements (e.g., 1000 IU vitamin D) per **Artifact_14_SupplementRecommendations_PlanA.md** ([message](#message-4327a6b3-0da6-4db9-95c3-b99b88abf635)).
  - **Symptom Correlation**: If symptoms >2 (e.g., bloating post-kale), reduce trigger foods (e.g., kale to 15 g/meal) or substitute (e.g., cauliflower) per **Artifact_25_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanB.md** ([message](#message-4b05b1d7-1e02-4c50-a73a-d8d65a0a0c6e)).
- **Consultation**: Share Cronometer/MySymptoms data with a nutritionist by July 1, 2025, to verify nutrient adequacy and symptom control; adjust plan if gaps persist (e.g., iron <9 mg/day, fatigue >2) ([Artifact_20_LongTermPlanning_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_20_LongTermPlanning_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Plan B Focus**: This artifact defines Plan B’s nutritional standards, prioritizing simplicity and cost-efficiency compared to Plan A’s broader nutrient diversity (~18 foods vs. 9) ([Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: All standards ensure **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** compliance, minimizing MS symptom triggers ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Budget**: Standards align with Plan B’s budget (~$99.63–$112.73 without optionals), using fewer ingredients than Plan A (~$141.13–$149.88) ([Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Standards support the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals through high flavonoids and omega-3s ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
- **Usability**: Simplified nutrient targets and fewer foods make Plan B accessible for MS patients with energy or cognitive constraints.
- **ZIP Request**: Your prior request for a ZIP file for Windows ([message](#message-4327a6b3-0da6-4db9-95c3-b99b88abf635]) included **Artifact_22** as a placeholder. This full output can replace the placeholder. Confirm if an updated ZIP or alternative delivery (e.g., cloud link) is needed.
