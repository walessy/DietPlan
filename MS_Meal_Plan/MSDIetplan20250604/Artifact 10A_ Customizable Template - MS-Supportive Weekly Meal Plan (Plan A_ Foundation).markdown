# Artifact 10A: Customizable Template - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 10A: Customizable Template (Plan A: Foundation)**, providing customization options for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan A, the foundation plan, delivers ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal chicken). This document offers substitutions and adjustments to the menu (**Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md**) to accommodate digestive issues, histamine reactions, or preferences, while preserving nutrient targets. **Plan B** has a separate customizable template (see **Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md**).

## Customization Options

Plan A’s menu includes 18 foods across 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners) within a 16:8 fasting schedule (12:00 PM–8:00 PM). The following options allow substitutions and adjustments to maintain **mTOR/leucine** (~9.6–12.2 g/day), **flavonoids** (~249.14–480.78 mg/day), **circadian alignment**, and **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, **low-antinutrient** requirements, addressing MS symptoms (e.g., fatigue, spasticity, neuropathy, cognitive decline).

### Protein Substitutions
- **Objective**: Maintain ~115 g/day protein (~57.5 g/meal), ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine (~4.8–6.1 g/meal) for mTOR-driven brain-muscle connection ([Artifact_08A_LeucineTiming_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_08A_LeucineTiming_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Customization Goals**: Substitutions maintain ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, ~39 g/day fiber, and low-histamine, low-oxalate, low-antinutrient properties, ensuring mTOR activation, dementia prevention, and MS symptom management ([Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan B**: Plan B’s template offers simpler substitutions (e.g., kiwi for oranges, beef for eggs) within 10 foods, maintaining ~104 g/day protein, ~9–10.4 g/day leucine, ~449–899 mg/day flavonoids, with fewer antinutrient concerns due to no soaking requirements ([Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track substituted nutrients via **Cronometer**; monitor symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, sleep, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** to evaluate substitution efficacy ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Budget Impact**: Substitutions may increase costs (e.g., ~$3.50 for oranges, ~$4.00 for turkey); stay within ~$128.93–$137.68 budget, with ~$5.57–$7.24 remaining ([Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Ensure substitutes are low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), and prepared to minimize antinutrients (e.g., peel, soak, cook); avoid apples/cocoa to prevent neuropathy exacerbation ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
