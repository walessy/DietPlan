# Artifact 10A: Customizable Template - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 10A: Customizable Template (Plan A: Foundation)**, providing customization options for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan A, the foundation plan, delivers ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal chicken). This document offers substitutions and adjustments for Plan A and Plan B to accommodate dietary restrictions, preferences, or availability, preserving nutrient targets. Plan B is a simplified derivative ([Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md)).

## Customization Options

The following options allow substitutions for Plan A’s menu (18 foods across 14 meals) within a 16:8 fasting schedule (12:00 PM–8:00 PM), maintaining **mTOR/leucine** (~9.6–12.2 g/day), **flavonoids** (~249.14–480.78 mg/day), **circadian alignment**, and **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, **low-antinutrient** requirements. Plan B options are in **Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md**.

### Protein Substitutions (Plan A)
- **If Histamine Reaction to Chicken Liver (Wednesday dinner, 50 g, ~1.0–1.2 g leucine, SIGHI score 2)**:
  - **Substitute**: 100 g tinned sardines/mackerel (~1.8–2.0 g leucine, SIGHI score 0–1, ~$1.25/125 g can).
  - **Impact**: Increases leucine (~1.8–2.0 g), omega-3s (~1.72–3.43 g), reduces vitamin A (~2145 µg RAE to ~60 µg RAE), safer for histamine intolerance.
  - **Adjustment**: Consume within 24 hours; monitor histamine symptoms (1–10 scale, aim <2) via **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **If Digestive Issues with Tofu (7 meals, 100 g, ~1.5 g leucine, SIGHI score 1–2)**:
  - **Substitute**: 4 additional eggs (~2.0–2.4 g leucine, SIGHI score 0, ~$0.45/4 eggs).
  - **Impact**: Increases leucine (~2.0–2.4 g), choline (~500 mg), maintains low-histamine; requires additional ~28 eggs/week (~$3.15).
  - **Adjustment**: Hard-boil eggs (10–12 min); ensure low-histamine preparation ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).

  - **Adjustment**: Serve raw; adjust fiber with reduced seeds (e.g., chia, ~4.5 g/15 g).

### Staple Substitutions (Plan A)
- **If Chicken Restriction Prevents Bone Broth (14 meals, 400 ml, ~12 g protein, ~80–160 mg calcium, SIGHI score 1–2)**:
  - **Substitute**: 400 ml fortified oat milk (~4 g protein, ~480 mg calcium, ~$0.80/400 ml).
  - **Impact**: Reduces protein (~12 g to ~4 g, ~57.5 g/meal to ~45.5 g/meal, ~115 g/day to ~91 g/day), increases calcium (~80–160 mg to ~480 mg, ~751–821 mg/meal to ~1111–1281 mg/day), potassium (~200 mg to ~600 mg, ~2453 mg/meal to ~2853 mg/meal, ~4906 mg/day to ~5706 mg/day), vitamin D (~0 IU to ~176 IU), B12 (~0 µg to ~1.52 µg); maintains low-histamine (SIGHI score 0), low-oxalate (~0 mg/100 ml); removes collagen, impacting gut health. Requires additional ~5600 ml oat milk/week (~$11.20).
  - **Adjustment**: Add 2 eggs/meal (from 4 to 6, ~12 g protein, ~$0.22/2 eggs, ~28 eggs/week, ~$3.08) to restore ~57.5 g/meal (~115 g/day); increase ginger (5 g to 10 g/meal, ~$0.05, ~70 g/week, ~$0.70) for gut health. Hard-boil eggs (10–12 min); serve oat milk as broth base or beverage; consume within 24 hours, refrigerate 35–40°F. Monitor protein (~115 g/day) and symptoms (digestion, fatigue, 1–10 scale, aim <2) via **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
  - **Cost**: ~$14.98/week (~$11.20 oat milk, ~$3.08 eggs, ~$0.70 ginger), increasing budget to ~$132.01–$140.76, within ~$128.93–$137.68.
- **If Caffeine Sensitivity from Green Tea (14 meals, 100 ml, ~100–200 mg EGCG)**:
  - **Substitute**: 100 ml decaffeinated green tea (~75–150 mg EGCG, ~$0.03/1 bag).

  - **Adjustment**: Ensure oat milk is fortified; monitor protein (~115 g/day) via **Cronometer**.

## Notes
- **Customization Goals**: Substitutions maintain ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, ~39 g/day fiber, and low-histamine, low-oxalate, low-antinutrient properties, ensuring mTOR activation, dementia prevention, and MS symptom management ([Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan B**: Plan B offers simpler substitutions (10 foods, no soaking) for cost (~$92.70–$103.80); Plan A’s broader menu (18 foods) supports variety but increases complexity (~$128.93–$137.68) ([Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track nutrients via **Cronometer**; monitor symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Budget Impact**: Substitutions (e.g., oat milk, eggs) stay within ~$128.93–$140.76; adjust for cost increases ([Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Ensure substitutes are low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), and prepared to minimize antinutrients; avoid apples/cocoa ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
