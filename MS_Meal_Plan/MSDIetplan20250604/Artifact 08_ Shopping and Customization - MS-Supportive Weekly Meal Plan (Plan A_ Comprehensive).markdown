# Artifact 08: Shopping and Customization - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 08: Shopping and Customization - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)**, providing shopping and customization options for **Plan A**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan A is a comprehensive dietary approach with 18 foods, delivering ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids to support **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document offers strategies for shopping flexibility and menu customization, ensuring adherence to nutritional standards while accommodating availability, preferences, or symptom-driven adjustments.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Enables flexibility in sourcing ingredients and customizing Plan A’s 7-day menu (14 meals) to maintain nutrient targets (~57.5 g protein, ~4.8–6.1 g leucine, ~129.57–245.39 mg flavonoids per meal) while addressing availability, cost, taste preferences, or MS symptoms (fatigue, bloating, cognition, neuropathy).
- **Shopping Flexibility**: Strategies for sourcing 18 ingredients (eggs, tinned sardines, tinned mackerel, tofu, avocado, zucchini, broccoli, kale, strawberries, blueberries, quinoa, fortified oat milk, green tea, olive oil, rice, spinach, cauliflower, flaxseed oil) from multiple retailers or substituting unavailable items ([Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md)).
- **Customization**: Options to modify ingredients, portion sizes, or preparation methods within low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), and low-antinutrient criteria ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Use **Cronometer** for nutrient tracking and **MySymptoms** for symptom monitoring (1–10 scale, aim <2 for symptoms, >7 for cognition) to validate adjustments ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Budget**: Maintains Plan A’s budget (~$141.13–$149.88) with cost-effective substitutions and sourcing ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).

## Shopping Flexibility

### Strategies
- **Multiple Retailers**:
  - **Primary**: ASDA for cost efficiency; order online by Tuesday, June 3, 2025, for delivery by Wednesday, June 4, 2025 ([Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md)).
  - **Alternatives**: Tesco, Sainsbury’s, or local markets if ASDA lacks stock (e.g., fresh kale, organic strawberries). Compare prices online; expect ~5–10% cost variation.
  - **Bulk Purchases**: Buy eggs (5 dozen), tinned fish (2 cases of 12 cans), or quinoa (1 kg) to reduce unit costs; ensure storage at 35–40°F for perishables ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
- **Seasonal Adjustments**:
  - Use in-season produce (e.g., strawberries, blueberries in June) for freshness and lower costs; substitute with frozen (SIGHI score 0) if unavailable, rinsing to reduce histamine.
  - Check local market availability for zucchini, broccoli, or kale; select firm, vibrant vegetables to ensure low histamine.
- **Quality Verification**:
  - Confirm SIGHI score 0–1, low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), and no additives (e.g., tinned fish in water, not oil or spices) per **Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md**.
  - Inspect eggs for freshness (check expiration), tofu for firm texture, and avocados for ripeness (soft but not mushy).
- **Cost Management**:
  - Opt for store brands (e.g., ASDA oat milk, olive oil) to save ~10–15% without compromising quality.
  - Use loyalty programs or discounts at Tesco/Sainsbury’s to offset costs; avoid premium organic unless budget allows (~$15–$20 extra/week) ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).

### Handling Unavailability
- **Substitutes**: If primary ingredients are unavailable, use alternatives from **Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**:
  - **Quinoa**: Replace with white basmati rice (200 g backup supply).
  - **Kale**: Replace with spinach (200 g backup supply).
  - **Broccoli/Zucchini**: Replace with cauliflower (200 g backup supply).
  - **Strawberries/Blueberries**: Replace with raspberries (SIGHI score 0, ~2 mg/100 g oxalate).
  - **Tinned Fish**: Swap sardines/mackerel with each other or tinned herring in water (SIGHI score 0).
- **Nutrient Equivalence**: Ensure substitutes meet protein, leucine, flavonoid, calcium, and potassium targets per **Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md** (e.g., spinach for kale maintains ~150 mg calcium/100 g).
- **Sourcing**: Check Tesco/Sainsbury’s or local markets for substitutes; order additional items by June 3, 2025, to align with delivery timeline.

## Customization Options

### Ingredient Substitutions
- **Protein Sources**:
  - **Eggs (3/meal)**: Reduce to 2 eggs + 50 g tofu if cholesterol concerns arise (~496 mg/day vs. ~744 mg/day); maintain ~57.5 g protein/meal.
  - **Tinned Sardines/Mackerel (100 g/meal)**: Swap with tinned herring (100 g, ~25 g protein, ~1.8 g leucine) or increase tofu to 150 g if fish unavailable.
  - **Tofu (100 g/meal)**: Replace with 100 g tempeh (SIGHI score 0, non-fermented, ~10 g protein) if preferred; steam to reduce phytates.
- **Vegetables**:
  - **Zucchini/Broccoli (100 g/meal)**: Substitute with cauliflower (100 g, ~0.5 mg oxalate, steam 8–10 min) or green beans (~1 mg oxalate).
  - **Kale (30 g/meal)**: Replace with spinach (30 g, ~2 mg oxalate, steam 5–7 min) or Swiss chard (~1 mg oxalate).
- **Fruits**:
  - **Strawberries/Blueberries (100 g/meal)**: Substitute with raspberries (100 g, ~20 mg flavonoids, ~2 mg oxalate) or blackberries (~25 mg flavonoids).
- **Carbohydrates**:
  - **Quinoa (50 g/meal)**: Replace with white basmati rice (50 g, ~0 mg oxalate, boil 10–15 min) or buckwheat (~0 mg oxalate, boil 10 min).
- **Beverages**:
  - **Green Tea (200 ml/meal)**: Swap with white tea (SIGHI score 0, ~100 mg flavonoids/200 ml, brew at 80–85°C) or chamomile tea (~50 mg flavonoids, soothing for digestion).
  - **Fortified Oat Milk (400 g/meal)**: Replace with fortified rice milk (SIGHI score 0, ~480 mg calcium/400 g) if oat milk unavailable.
- **Fats**:
  - **Olive Oil (15 ml/meal)**: Substitute with flaxseed oil (15 ml, ~2 g omega-3s, use cold) or avocado oil (SIGHI score 0, high heat stable).

### Portion Adjustments
- **Symptom-Driven**:
  - **Bloating (>2 on 1–10 scale)**: Reduce kale to 15 g/meal, increase zucchini to 150 g/meal for easier digestion; monitor with **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md)).
  - **Fatigue (>2)**: Increase avocado to 150 g/meal for additional fats (~22.5 g vs. 15 g), supporting energy; adjust quinoa to 30 g to balance carbohydrates.
- **Preference-Driven**:
  - **Taste**: Increase strawberries/blueberries to 150 g/meal for sweetness, reduce tofu to 75 g to maintain protein (~57 g/meal).
  - **Texture**: Replace steamed tofu with sautéed (100 g, crispier texture); increase olive oil to 20 ml for richer flavor.
- **Nutrient Maintenance**: Use **Cronometer** to verify adjusted portions meet ~57.5 g protein, ~4.8–6.1 g leucine, ~129.57–245.39 mg flavonoids per meal ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).

### Preparation Variations
- **Cooking Methods**:
  - **Eggs**: Alternate between hard-boiled (10–12 min) and scrambled (3–5 min) for variety; poach (3–4 min) as an option (SIGHI score 0).
  - **Tofu**: Vary steaming (8–10 min), sautéing (5–7 min), or baking (350°F, 15 min) to change texture; use olive or flaxseed oil.
  - **Vegetables**: Rotate steaming (8–10 min) with roasting (375°F, 10–12 min) for zucchini, broccoli, or cauliflower to enhance flavor; ensure low-histamine.
- **Seasoning**:
  - Add fresh herbs (e.g., parsley, basil, SIGHI score 0) to tofu or vegetables for taste; use sparingly (~5 g/meal) to avoid histamine risk.
  - Drizzle flaxseed oil (5 ml) post-cooking for omega-3 boost without altering flavor.
- **Safety**: All variations must maintain low-histamine (consume within 24 hours), low-oxalate, and low-antinutrient profiles; refrigerate at 35–40°F ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).

## Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Tracking**: Use **Cronometer** to ensure substitutions and portion changes meet nutrient targets (protein, leucine, flavonoids, calcium, potassium) from **Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md**; track symptoms (fatigue, bloating, cognition, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) with **MySymptoms** to validate adjustments ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Adjustments**: If symptoms persist (e.g., bloating >2 after spinach substitution), revert to original ingredients or try alternative substitutes (e.g., Swiss chard for spinach); adjust preparation (e.g., steam vs. roast) to reduce digestive stress ([Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md)).
- **Consultation**: Consult a nutritionist for persistent symptoms, lipid monitoring due to egg/oil intake (~744 mg/day cholesterol), or to assess nutrient gaps; consider supplements if needed ([Artifact_14_SupplementRecommendations_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_14_SupplementRecommendations_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Plan A Focus**: This artifact supports Plan A’s comprehensive menu, offering more customization options than Plan B’s simpler approach ([Artifact_25_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_25_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanB.md)).
- **Safety**: All substitutions and preparations adhere to low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), and low-antinutrient criteria, critical for MS symptom management ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Budget**: Customization maintains Plan A’s budget (~$141.13–$149.88), with cost-effective substitutes and sourcing strategies ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Substitutions support the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals through flavonoid-rich foods (e.g., raspberries, blueberries) ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
- **Flexibility**: Options allow adaptation to local availability, taste, or symptoms while ensuring nutritional and safety standards.
