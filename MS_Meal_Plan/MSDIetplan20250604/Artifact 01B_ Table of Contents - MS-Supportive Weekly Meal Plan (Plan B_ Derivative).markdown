# Artifact 01B: Table of Contents - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 01B: Table of Contents (Plan B: Derivative)**, outlining the structure of a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan B, a simplified derivative of Plan A (see **Artifact_01A_ToC_PlanA.md**), delivers ~104 g/day protein, ~9–10.4 g/day leucine, and ~449–899 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no chicken). Shopping was ordered on June 3, 2025, for delivery on June 4, 2025 (~$92.70–$103.80). This document lists all articles for Plan B, focusing on simplicity and cost efficiency.

## Notes
- **Plan B Scope**: Simplified menu (10 foods) with reduced preparation complexity and histamine risk, suitable for cost-conscious users prioritizing high flavonoids.

- **Implementation**: Use Plan B for simplicity or Plan A for variety. Monitor via **MySymptoms**/**Cronometer** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Ensure low-histamine preparation (consume within 24 hours, refrigerate 35–40°F) ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
