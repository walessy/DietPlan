# Artifact 01B: Table of Contents - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative)

This is the **Table of Contents (Artifact_01B_ToC_PlanB.md)** for the MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg, covering June 25–July 1, 2025. Plan B, a derivative of **Plan A** (see **Artifact_01A_ToC_PlanA.md**), is simplified for cost, complexity, and histamine risk, adjusted for **increased mTOR activity** (~104 g/day protein, ~1.45 g/kg), **leucine** (~9–10.4 g/day), and **flavonoids** (~449–899 mg/day) to strengthen brain-muscle connection and reduce dementia risk, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal/no chicken). Shopping was ordered on June 3, 2025, for delivery on June 4, 2025, totaling ~$81.59–$92.69 (adjusted ~$92.70–$103.80). The project includes 5 Plan B articles, listed below with artifact IDs, version IDs, status, and descriptions, ordered for output.
