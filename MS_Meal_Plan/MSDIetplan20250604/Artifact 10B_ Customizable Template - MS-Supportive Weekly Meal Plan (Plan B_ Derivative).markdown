# Artifact 10B: Customizable Template - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 10B: Customizable Template (Plan B: Derivative)**, providing customization options for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan B, a simplified derivative of Plan A, delivers ~111 g/day protein, ~10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, and ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). Shopping was ordered on June 3, 2025, for delivery on June 4, 2025 (~$99.63–$112.73 without aloe vera/carrots, ~$103.13–$116.23 with aloe vera/carrots). This document offers substitutions for Plan B’s menu (9 foods across 14 meals) to accommodate dietary restrictions, preferences, or availability, preserving nutrient targets. For Plan A customizations, see **Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md**; for nutritional standards, see **Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md**; for menu, see **Artifact_04B_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md**; for shopping, see **Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md**; for tracking, see **Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md**.

## Customization Options

Plan B’s menu includes 9 foods across 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners) within a 16:8 fasting schedule (12:00 PM–8:00 PM). The following substitutions maintain **mTOR/leucine** (~10.4–12.0 g/day), **flavonoids** (~419–839 mg/day), **circadian alignment**, and **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, **low-antinutrient** requirements, with a safer egg ratio (2 whole eggs + 3 egg whites/meal) to reduce cholesterol intake.

### Protein Substitutions
- **If Histamine Reaction to Tinned Fish (12 meals, 150 g, ~2.7–3.0 g leucine, SIGHI score 0–1)**:
  - **Substitute**: 3 additional whole eggs (~1.5–1.8 g leucine, SIGHI score 0, ~$0.33/3 eggs).
  - **Impact**: Increases leucine (~2.7–3.0 g to ~3.4–4.05 g/meal, ~10.4–12.0 g to ~11.8–14.1 g/day), protein (~37.5 g to ~18 g/meal, ~111 g to ~81 g/day), cholesterol (~744 mg to ~1302 mg/day, requires lipid monitoring), choline (~500 mg to ~875 mg/day), reduces omega-3s (~1.72–3.43 g to ~0 g), maintains low-histamine; requires additional ~36 eggs/week (~$3.96).
  - **Adjustment**: Hard-boil eggs (10–12 min); consume within 24 hours; monitor omega-3 intake via **Cronometer** and cholesterol via lipid panel (HDL ≥60 mg/dL, LDL <100 mg/dL) ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)). Consult a nutritionist/doctor due to increased cholesterol.
  - **Cost**: ~$3.96/week, budget ~$103.59–$116.69 (without optionals).
- **If Preference for Reduced Egg Intake (2 whole eggs + 3 whites/meal, ~1.9–2.25 g leucine)**:
  - **Substitute**: 100 g lactose-free milk/meal (from 150 ml to 250 ml, ~3.6 g to ~9 g protein, ~0.3 g to ~0.75 g leucine, ~$0.20 to ~$0.50/100 ml).
  - **Impact**: Increases protein (~55.5 g to ~60.9 g/meal, ~111 g to ~121.8 g/day), leucine (~5.2–6.0 g to ~5.65–6.45 g/meal, ~10.4–12.0 g to ~11.3–12.9 g/day), calcium (~1128–1388 mg to ~1248–1508 mg/meal, ~1800–2040 mg to ~2040–2280 mg/day), maintains low-histamine (SIGHI score 0); requires additional ~1400 ml milk/week (~$2.80).
  - **Adjustment**: Ensure milk is refrigerated (35–40°F); consume within 24 hours; monitor protein (~111 g/day) and digestion (1–10 scale, aim <2) via **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms**. Maintain lipid monitoring due to whole eggs.
  - **Cost**: ~$2.80/week, budget ~$102.43–$115.53 (without optionals).

### Vegetable Substitutions
- **If Bloating from Broccoli (7 lunches, 100 g, ~2.5 g fiber, ~2 mg oxalate)**:
  - **Substitute**: 100 g romaine lettuce (~2 g fiber, ~1 mg oxalate, ~$0.20/100 g).
  - **Impact**: Slightly reduces fiber (~2.5 g to ~2 g, ~38.6 g/day to ~38.1 g/day), oxalates (~2 mg to ~1 mg), maintains low-histamine (SIGHI score 0); requires additional ~700 g lettuce (~$1.40).
  - **Adjustment**: Serve raw; monitor bloating (1–10 scale, aim <2) via **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
  - **Cost**: ~$1.40/week, budget ~$101.03–$114.13 (without optionals).
- **If Availability or Preference Issue for Kale (30 g/meal, all 14 meals, ~1.2 g fiber, ~15–30 mg flavonoids)**:
  - **Substitute**: 30 g parsley (chopped, ~0.9 g fiber, ~30–60 mg flavonoids, ~$0.15/30 g).
  - **Impact**: Reduces fiber (~1.2 g to ~0.9 g, ~38.6 g/day to ~38 g/day), increases flavonoids (~15–30 mg to ~30–60 mg, ~419–839 mg/day to ~449–899 mg/day), potassium (~104 mg to ~166 mg, ~4376 mg/day to ~4500 mg/day), vitamin A (~90 µg RAE to ~252 µg RAE, ~400 µg RAE/day to ~560 µg RAE/day), iron (~0.5 mg to ~1.8 mg, ~9.1 mg/day to ~11.7 mg/day); maintains low-histamine (SIGHI score 0), low-oxalate (~0.3–0.6 mg/30 g).
  - **Adjustment**: Chop parsley fresh; consume within 24 hours; reduce green tea (300 ml to 200 ml/meal, ~$0.05, ~200–400 mg EGCG) if flavonoids exceed ~899 mg/day. Monitor symptoms (neuropathy, histamine reactions, fatigue, 1–10 scale, aim <2) via **MySymptoms**/**Cronometer** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
  - **Cost**: ~420 g parsley/week (~$2.10), comparable to kale (~$2.10).

### Staple Substitutions
- **If Chicken Restriction Prevents Bone Broth (14 meals, 400 ml, ~12 g protein, ~80–160 mg calcium, SIGHI score 1–2)**:
  - **Substitute**: 400 ml fortified oat milk (~4 g protein, ~480 mg calcium, ~$0.80/400 ml).
  - **Impact**: Reduces protein (~12 g to ~4 g, ~55.5 g/meal to ~47.5 g/meal without egg/fish adjustments, ~111 g/day to ~95 g/day), increases calcium (~80–160 mg to ~480 mg, ~1128–1388 mg/meal to ~1800–2040 mg/day), potassium (~200 mg to ~600 mg, ~2850 mg/meal to ~3250 mg/meal, ~5700 mg/day to ~6500 mg/day), vitamin D (~0 IU to ~176 IU), B12 (~0 µg to ~1.52 µg); maintains low-histamine (SIGHI score 0), low-oxalate (~0 mg/100 ml); removes collagen, impacting gut health. Requires additional ~5600 ml oat milk/week (~$11.20).
  - **Adjustment**: Use 2 whole eggs + 3 egg whites/meal (~15 g protein), 150 g tinned fish/12 meals (~37.5 g protein), 150 ml lactose-free milk/meal (~5.4 g protein) to restore ~55.5 g/meal (~111 g/day); maintain kiwi (200 g/meal, ~$9.80/week) for fiber (~38.6 g/day); use 2 g fresh ginger root/meal (~$0.14/week); optional 30 ml aloe vera juice/meal (~$2.10/week) for gut health if histamine-tolerant. Hard-boil eggs/whites (10–12 min); serve oat milk as broth base or beverage; consume within 24 hours, refrigerate 35–40°F. Monitor protein (~111 g/day), cholesterol (via lipid panel), and symptoms (digestion, fatigue, 1–10 scale, aim <2) via **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms**; consult a nutritionist/doctor ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
  - **Cost**: ~$12.53/week (~$11.20 oat milk, ~$2.45 kiwi, ~$0.14 ginger, ~$2.10 aloe vera – ~$5.60 bone broth, ~$0.56 ginger savings), budget ~$99.63–$116.23.
- **If Preference for Reduced Whole Egg Cholesterol (2 whole eggs/meal, ~744 mg/day cholesterol)**:
  - **Substitute**: 1 whole egg + 5 egg whites/meal (~1 whole egg/day, ~372 mg/day cholesterol, ~$0.11/egg + ~$0.25/150 ml whites).
  - **Impact**: Maintains protein (~15 g/meal, ~111 g/day), leucine (~1.9–2.25 g to ~2.1–2.45 g/meal, ~10.4–12.0 g to ~10.8–12.4 g/day), reduces cholesterol (~744 mg to ~372 mg/day, below guideline <300 mg/day with monitoring), choline (~500 mg to ~375 mg/day, slightly below MS need ~550 mg/day), vitamin A (~112 µg to ~56 µg RAE/meal, ~400 µg to ~344 µg RAE/day), B12 (~0.7 µg to ~0.35 µg/meal, ~4.29 µg to ~3.94 µg/day), iron (~0.25 mg to ~0.125 mg/meal, ~9.1 mg to ~9.0 mg/day), calcium (~15 mg to ~7.5 mg/meal, ~1800–2040 mg/day to ~1785–2025 mg/day); maintains low-histamine (SIGHI score 0). Requires ~14 whole eggs/week (~$1.54), ~700 ml egg whites/week (~$3.50).
  - **Adjustment**: Hard-boil eggs/whites (10–12 min); consume within 24 hours; increase fish (150 g to 200 g/12 meals, ~$18.75 to ~$25.00) for choline (~20 mg/100 g), B12 (~1.94 µg to ~2.59 µg/meal), iron (~3 mg to ~4 mg/meal); add carrots (50 g/meal, ~$1.40/week) for vitamin A (~200 µg RAE/meal, ~344 µg to ~744 µg RAE/day). Monitor cholesterol/lipid panels (HDL ≥60 mg/dL, LDL <100 mg/dL, triglycerides <150 mg/dL), consult a nutritionist/doctor, track symptoms (digestion, fatigue, cognition, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms**/**Cronometer** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
  - **Cost**: ~$6.44/week (~$1.54 eggs, ~$3.50 whites, ~$6.25 fish, ~$1.40 carrots – ~$3.08 eggs, ~$2.17 fish savings), budget ~$103.57–$116.67.
- **If Preference for Alternative to Fresh Ginger Root (2 g/meal, anti-inflammatory, SIGHI score 0)**:
  - **Substitute**: 0.5 g ground ginger (~1/8 tsp, anti-inflammatory, SIGHI score 0, ~$0.02/0.5 g).
  - **Impact**: Maintains anti-inflammatory benefits (gingerols), flavor, and low-histamine, low-oxalate (~0 mg/100 g), low-antinutrient properties; requires ~7 g ground ginger/week (~$0.14). Slightly less potent than fresh ginger but equivalent in effect at ~1:4 ratio (0.5 g ground ≈ 2 g fresh).
  - **Adjustment**: Sprinkle ground ginger into meals or green tea; consume within meal prep; monitor digestion (1–10 scale, aim <2) via **MySymptoms**. Alternatively, increase kiwi (200 g to 250 g/meal, ~$0.09/50 g, ~$12.25/week) for fiber (~38.6 g to ~39.7 g/day) if ginger is removed entirely.
  - **Cost**: ~$0.14/week, budget ~$99.63–$112.73 (without optionals).
- **If Caffeine Sensitivity from Green Tea (14 meals, 200 ml, ~200–400 mg EGCG)**:
  - **Substitute**: 200 ml decaffeinated green tea (~150–300 mg EGCG, ~$0.05/2 bags).
  - **Impact**: Slightly reduces flavonoids (~200–400 mg to ~150–300 mg, ~419–839 mg/day to ~369–789 mg/day), maintains low-histamine; requires ~28 decaf bags/week (~$0.70).
  - **Adjustment**: Steep decaf tea (80–85°C, 2–3 min); increase strawberries (100 g to 150 g, ~$0.50/50 g) to maintain ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids. Monitor flavonoid intake via **Cronometer**.
  - **Cost**: ~$0.70/week, budget ~$100.33–$113.43 (without optionals).
- **If Lactose-Free Milk Unavailable (14 meals, 150 ml, ~5.4 g protein, ~180 mg calcium)**:
  - **Substitute**: 300 ml fortified oat milk (~3 g protein, ~360 mg calcium, ~$0.60/300 ml).
  - **Impact**: Reduces protein (~5.4 g to ~3 g, ~55.5 g to ~53.1 g/meal, ~111 g to ~106.2 g/day), increases calcium (~180 mg to ~360 mg, ~1128–1388 mg to ~1308–1568 mg/meal, ~1800–2040 mg to ~1980–2220 mg/day), maintains low-histamine; requires additional ~4200 ml oat milk/week (~$8.40).
  - **Adjustment**: Ensure oat milk is fortified; increase fish (150 g to 200 g/12 meals, ~$18.75 to ~$25.00) to restore protein (~37.5 g to ~50 g/meal, ~106.2 g to ~118.2 g/day); monitor protein (~111 g/day) via **Cronometer**.
  - **Cost**: ~$8.40/week, budget ~$108.03–$121.13 (without optionals).

### Fruit Substitutions
- **If Bloating from Strawberries (14 meals, 100 g, ~20 mg flavonoids, ~2 g fiber)**:
  - **Substitute**: 100 g oranges (~10–20 mg flavonoids, ~2 g fiber, ~$0.25/100 g).
  - **Impact**: Maintains flavonoids (~10–20 mg), fiber (~2 g), low-oxalate (~2 mg/100 g), low-histamine (SIGHI score 0); requires ~1400 g oranges (~$3.50).
  - **Adjustment**: Peel oranges, serve raw; monitor bloating and flavonoid intake via **Cronometer** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
  - **Cost**: ~$3.50/week, budget ~$103.13–$116.23 (without optionals).
- **If Availability Issue for Kiwi (14 meals, 200 g, ~13.3–26.7 mg flavonoids, ~4 g fiber)**:
  - **Substitute**: 150 g blackberries (~30 mg flavonoids, ~6 g fiber, ~$1.13/150 g).
  - **Impact**: Increases flavonoids (~13.3–26.7 mg to ~30 mg, ~419–839 mg/day to ~435.7–855.7 mg/day), fiber (~4 g to ~6 g, ~38.6 g/day to ~41.6 g/day), low-oxalate (~3 mg/100 g); requires ~2100 g blackberries (~$15.82).
  - **Adjustment**: Serve raw; reduce seeds (e.g., pumpkin seeds, ~1 g fiber/15 g) to balance fiber (~38.6 g/day); monitor flavonoid intake via **Cronometer**.
  - **Cost**: ~$15.82/week, budget ~$115.45–$128.55 (without optionals).

## Notes
- **Customization Goals**: Substitutions maintain ~111 g/day protein, ~10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids, ~38.6 g/day fiber, and low-histamine, low-oxalate, low-antinutrient properties, ensuring mTOR activation, dementia prevention, and MS symptom management ([Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan A**: Plan A offers more substitutions (18 foods, e.g., tofu, lentils) with complex prep; Plan B’s simpler options (9 foods, no soaking) prioritize ease and cost (~$99.63–$116.23 vs. ~$141.13–$149.88) ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).
- **Health Monitoring**: Due to whole egg intake (4/day, ~744 mg cholesterol/day), monitor cholesterol/lipid panels (HDL ≥60 mg/dL, LDL <100 mg/dL, triglycerides <150 mg/dL) annually, consult a nutritionist or doctor for MS and age-related risks (>40), especially with high protein/leucine needs. Track nutrients via **Cronometer**; monitor symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)). Test aloe vera juice for histamine tolerance (start with 10 ml).
- **Budget Impact**: Substitutions (e.g., egg whites, fish, milk, kiwi, ginger, aloe vera, carrots) stay within ~$99.63–$116.23; adjust for cost increases (e.g., blackberries ~$15.82) ([Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **Safety**: Ensure substitutes are low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), and prepared to minimize antinutrients (e.g., steam kale); avoid apples/cocoa ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
