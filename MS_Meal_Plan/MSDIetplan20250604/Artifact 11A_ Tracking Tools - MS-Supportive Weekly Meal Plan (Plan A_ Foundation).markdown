# Artifact 11A: Tracking Tools - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 11A: Tracking Tools (Plan A: Foundation)**, detailing tools and methods for monitoring nutrient intake and MS symptoms during a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan A, the foundation plan, delivers \~115 g/day protein, \~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and \~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal chicken). This document recommends **Cronometer** for nutrient tracking and **MySymptoms** for symptom monitoring to ensure adherence to nutritional goals and evaluate MS symptom response (e.g., fatigue, spasticity, cognition). **Plan B** has separate tracking tools (see **Artifact_11B_TrackingTools_PlanB.md**). For nutritional standards, see **Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md**; for routine, see **Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md**; for menu, see **Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md**; for shopping, see **Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**; for customization, see **Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md**; for circadian health, see **Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md**.

## Tracking Tools

Effective tracking ensures Plan A meets nutrient targets (\~115 g/day protein, \~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, \~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids) and mitigates MS symptoms through dietary and circadian interventions. The following tools monitor intake, symptoms, and lifestyle factors.

### Cronometer (Nutrient Tracking)

- **Purpose**: Tracks macronutrients (protein, leucine, fiber), micronutrients (potassium, calcium, vitamin D, B12), and bioactive compounds (flavonoids, omega-3s, choline) to verify adherence to Plan A’s standards (Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md).
- **Setup**:
  - Download **Cronometer** (free version, iOS/Android/Web, https://cronometer.com/).
  - Input user profile (male, 54 years, 71.8 kg, MS-specific goals).
  - Log daily meals (12:00 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) from **Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md**, including quantities (e.g., 4 eggs, 100 g tinned fish, 100 ml green tea).
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Protein**: Aim \~115 g/day (\~57.5 g/meal, \~1.6 g/kg).
  - **Leucine**: Aim \~9.6–12.2 g/day (\~4.8–6.1 g/meal) for mTOR activation (Artifact_08A_LeucineTiming_PlanA.md).
  - **Fiber**: Aim \~39 g/day (\~19.5 g/meal) to support gut health.
  - **Flavonoids**: Aim \~249.14–480.78 mg/day (\~124.57–240.39 mg/meal) for dementia prevention (Artifact_16A_FlavonoidsDementia_PlanA.md).
  - **Potassium**: Aim \~4906 mg/day (\~2453 mg/meal, above UK RNI 3500 mg/day).
  - **Calcium**: Aim \~1502.71–1642.71 mg/day (\~751–821 mg/meal, above UK RNI 700 mg/day).
  - **Vitamin D**: Aim \~2600–3700 IU/day (\~1300–1850 IU/meal, MS-specific 2000–4000 IU/day).
  - **Vitamin B12**: Aim \~6.24 µg/day (\~3.12 µg/meal, above UK RNI 1.5 µg/day).
  - **Choline**: Aim \~500 mg/day (\~250 mg/meal) for sleep regulation.
  - **Omega-3s**: Aim \~1.72–3.43 g/day (\~0.86–1.72 g/meal in fish-based meals).
  - **Iron**: Aim \~12.66 mg/day (\~6.33 mg/meal, above UK RNI 8.7 mg/day).
  - **Vitamin A**: Aim \~2258.5 µg RAE/day (\~1129.25 µg RAE/meal, monitor toxicity, UK UL 1500 µg/day).
- **Usage**:
  - Log daily intake (e.g., Wednesday lunch: 4 eggs, 100 g sardines, 100 g tofu, 200 g zucchini, 100 g strawberries, 100 ml green tea).
  - Review nutrient summaries to ensure targets are met; adjust portions or substitutions (e.g., oranges for strawberries) if deficits occur (Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md).
  - Monitor vitamin A on Wednesday (liver dinner, \~2145 µg RAE/50 g) to avoid toxicity (nausea, headache, aim &lt;2 on symptom scale).

### MySymptoms (Symptom Tracking)

- **Purpose**: Monitors MS symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, neuropathy, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, sleep quality) to evaluate Plan A’s efficacy and guide adjustments (Artifact_05A_NerveHealth_PlanA.md).
- **Setup**:
  - Download **MySymptoms** (iOS/Android, https://mysymptoms.net/, free/premium options).
  - Create profile with MS-specific symptoms and triggers (e.g., histamine, oxalates, poor sleep).
  - Set daily reminders to log symptoms (e.g., morning, post-meals, bedtime).
- **Key Metrics (1–10 Scale, Daily)**:
  - **Fatigue**: Aim &lt;2 (low fatigue); high scores may indicate histamine reactions or sleep disruption.
  - **Spasticity**: Aim &lt;2 (minimal muscle stiffness); high scores may suggest leucine or omega-3 deficits.
  - **Neuropathy**: Aim &lt;2 (minimal tingling/numbness); high scores may indicate oxalate or histamine issues.
  - **Cognition**: Aim &gt;7 (clear thinking); low scores may reflect poor sleep or flavonoid deficits.
  - **Bloating**: Aim &lt;2 (minimal digestive discomfort); high scores may suggest lentils/tofu intolerance.
  - **Histamine Reactions**: Aim &lt;2 (minimal itching, flushing); high scores may indicate issues with liver, tofu, or lentils.
  - **Sleep Quality**: Aim &gt;7 (restful sleep); low scores may reflect circadian misalignment or choline deficits.
- **Usage**:
  - Log symptoms post-meals (12:00 PM, 7:30–8:00 PM) and at bedtime (10:00 PM).
  - Note triggers (e.g., liver on Wednesday dinner, lentils on Saturday/Monday lunches).
  - Review trends to identify correlations (e.g., high bloating with lentils, low cognition with poor sleep).
  - Adjust menu via substitutions if symptoms exceed targets (e.g., replace lentils with broccoli if bloating &gt;2) (Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md).

### Circadian and Lifestyle Tracking

- **Purpose**: Monitors circadian alignment (meal timing, light exposure, sleep) to optimize melatonin production and recovery (Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md).
- **Tools**: Use **MySymptoms** or a journal (e.g., notebook, Notes app) to log:
  - **Meal Timing**: Record lunch (12:00 PM ±30 min) and dinner (7:30–8:00 PM ±30 min) to ensure 16:8 fasting window adherence (Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md).
  - **Daylight Exposure**: Log 30–60 min exposure (10:00 AM–2:00 PM, aim for \~500–1000 IU vitamin D).
  - **Evening Light**: Confirm red light use (6:00 PM–bedtime, 2700K bulbs) and blue-light avoidance (e.g., glasses post-6:00 PM).
  - **Sleep Duration**: Record hours slept (10:00 PM–6:00 AM, aim 7–9 hours).
- **Usage**:
  - Log daily circadian activities (e.g., “12:05 PM lunch, 1:00 PM 45 min walk in sunlight, 7:45 PM dinner, 10:00 PM red light, 7.5 hours sleep”).
  - Review for consistency; adjust if sleep quality &lt;7 (e.g., increase evening parsley for flavonoids, ensure blackout curtains).

## Notes

- **Tracking Goals**: Ensure nutrient targets (\~115 g/day protein, \~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, \~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids) and symptom control (fatigue, spasticity, neuropathy, cognition &lt;2; cognition, sleep &gt;7) to support mTOR activation, dementia prevention, and MS symptom management (Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md).
- **Comparison to Plan B**: Plan B tracks similar metrics (\~104 g/day protein, \~9–10.4 g/day leucine, \~449–899 mg/day flavonoids) with simpler menu, focusing on higher flavonoids and fewer antinutrient concerns (Artifact_11B_TrackingTools_PlanB.md).
- **Monitoring Frequency**: Daily logging for meals, symptoms, and circadian activities; weekly review to assess trends and adjust via **Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md**. Consult dietitian if persistent issues (e.g., fatigue &gt;2, cognition &lt;7).
- **Safety**: Monitor vitamin A toxicity (Wednesday dinner, liver, aim &lt;2 for nausea/headache); ensure low-histamine preparation (consume within 24 hours, refrigerate 35–40°F) for fish, liver, tofu (Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md).
- **Data Integration**: Correlate **Cronometer** nutrient data with **MySymptoms** trends to guide substitutions (e.g., reduce lentils if bloating &gt;2, increase eggs if leucine &lt;9.6 g/day).
