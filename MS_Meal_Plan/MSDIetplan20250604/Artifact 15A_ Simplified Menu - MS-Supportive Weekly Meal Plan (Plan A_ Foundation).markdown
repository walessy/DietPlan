# Artifact 15A: Simplified Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Simplified Menu

This is **Artifact 15A: Simplified Menu (Plan A: Foundation)**, providing a concise overview of a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. The plan favors **low histamine**, **low oxalates**, and **low antinutrients**, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal), ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids across two meals (12:00 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. It enhances **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuin** activation, **telomere** maintenance, **mTOR activity**, **leucine**, and **flavonoids** to strengthen the brain-muscle connection and reduce dementia risk, while addressing user preferences (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal chicken to avoid constipation). **Plan B** is a separate derivative plan (see **Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md**).

### Notes
- **Mitochondrial Health**: Plan A delivers cofactors (**thiamine** ~1.45 mg/day, **niacin** ~20 mg NE/day, **magnesium** ~350 mg/day, **vitamin D** ~2600–3700 IU/day) for **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, flavonoids (~249.14–480.78 mg/day) for **mitophagy** and **sirtuin** activation, and **alpha-lipoic acid** (broccoli), **acetic acid** (vinegar), **curcumin** (turmeric), **genistein** (tofu) to balance **mTOR activity**, supporting MS energy, cognition, and neuroprotection ([Artifact_14A_MitochondrialStrategies_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_14A_MitochondrialStrategies_PlanA.md)).
- **MS Symptom Management**: **Fiber** (~39 g/day) alleviates constipation; **vitamin D** reduces relapse risk; **flavonoids** and **omega-3s** (~1.72–3.43 g/day from fish) mitigate spasticity and cognitive decline; **choline** (~500 mg/day from eggs) supports alertness/sleep; **B12** (~6.24 µg/day) and **iron** (~12.66 mg/day) reduce fatigue and neuropathy; minimal chicken minimizes constipation risk ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Preparation and Storage**: Complex prep (soaking lentils/tofu/seeds, boiling, sautéing, steaming, roasting); freeze chicken, liver, tofu; refrigerate eggs, fish, vegetables, fruits, milk; store seeds, spices, tea at 50–70°F ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Cook to 165°F; consume/refrigerate within 24 hours; monitor histamine reactions, vitamin A toxicity (nausea, headache, 1–10 scale, aim <2) in **MySymptoms**; reduce liver if symptoms >2 ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Budget of ~$128.93–$137.68, with ~$5.57–$7.24 remaining ([Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md)).
- **Customization**: Swap strawberries with oranges (~10–20 mg flavonoids/100 g, ~$2.50/1000 g) if bloating; reduce lentils/tofu if digestive issues; consult dietitian if nutrient deficits detected ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).
