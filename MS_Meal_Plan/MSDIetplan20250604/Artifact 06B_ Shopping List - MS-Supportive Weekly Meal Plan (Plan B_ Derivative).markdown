# Artifact 06B: Shopping List - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 06B: Shopping List (Plan B: Derivative)**, detailing the ingredients required for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan B, a simplified derivative of Plan A, delivers ~111 g/day protein, ~10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, and ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids to support **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **mitochondrial health**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). Shopping was ordered on June 3, 2025, for delivery on June 4, 2025, totaling ~$99.63–$112.73 (without aloe vera/carrots), or ~$103.13–$116.23 (with aloe vera/carrots). The shopping list supports a simplified menu (9 foods, 13 items, ~$99.63–$116.23) for two meals/day (12:00 PM, 7:30–8:00 PM) within a 16:8 fasting schedule. For Plan A, see **Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**; for standards, see **Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md**; for menu, see **Artifact_04B_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md**; for customizations, see **Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md**; for tracking, see **Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md**.

- **Budget Notes**: ~$0–$13.37 remaining for contingencies (e.g., price fluctuations, substitutions) within ~$99.63–$116.23 ([Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md)).

## Notes
- **Storage**:
  - **Protein Sources**: Refrigerate eggs, whites, fish at 35–40°F; consume within 24 hours of cooking to minimize histamine ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
  - **Vegetables/Fruits**: Refrigerate broccoli, lettuce, kale, kiwi, strawberries, carrots at 35–40°F; steam kale (~3–5 min) to reduce oxalates/goitrogens.
  - **Staples**: Refrigerate milk, oat milk, aloe vera juice at 35–40°F; store seeds, green tea, ginger at 50–70°F.
- **Preparation**:
  - Simplified prep: Boil eggs/whites/fish, steam broccoli/kale, serve lettuce/kiwi/strawberries raw; use oat milk as broth base or beverage; consume within 24 hours; grate 2 g fresh ginger root/meal ([Artifact_04B_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_04B_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md)).
  - Prioritize eggs/whites (2 whole + 3 whites/meal), fish for leucine/omega-3s; kiwi (200 g/meal) for fiber; optional aloe vera juice (30 g/meal) for gut health.
- **Sourcing**: All items available at ASDA, with alternatives (e.g., Tesco, Sainsbury’s). Verify availability for June 3, 2025, order.
- **Comparison**: Plan A’s list includes 32 items (~$141.13–$149.88, 18 foods) with complex prep. Plan B’s 13 items (~$99.63–$116.23, 9 foods) reduce cost, complexity, and histamine risk ([Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md)).
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor cholesterol/lipid panels (HDL ≥60 mg/dL, LDL <100 mg/dL, triglycerides <150 mg/dL) annually due to whole eggs (4/day, ~744 mg cholesterol/day), consult a nutritionist/doctor for MS and age-related risks (>40), track symptoms (digestion, fatigue, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms**/**Cronometer** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Customization**: Add carrots (~$1.40/700 g) or extra seeds (~$0.91/70 g) for vitamin A/iron; ensure substitutions maintain flavonoids (~419–839 mg/day) ([Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md)).
