# Artifact 06B: Shopping List - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 06B: Shopping List (Plan B: Derivative)**, detailing the ingredients required for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan B, a derivative of **Plan A** (see **Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**), is simplified for cost, complexity, and histamine risk, adjusted for **increased mTOR activity** (~104 g/day protein, ~1.45 g/kg), **leucine** (~9–10.4 g/day), and **flavonoids** (~449–899 mg/day) to strengthen brain-muscle connection and reduce dementia risk, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no chicken). Shopping was ordered on June 3, 2025, for delivery on June 4, 2025, totaling ~$92.70–$103.80 (adjusted from ~$81.59–$92.69 to include increased eggs, beef, kiwi, parsley). The shopping list supports a simplified menu (10 foods, 12 items, ~$92.70–$103.80) for two meals/day (12:00 PM, 7:30–8:00 PM) within a 16:8 fasting schedule.

## Shopping List (Plan B: Derivative, Tuesday, June 3, 2025)

The list includes 12 items (3 proteins, 3 vegetables, 2 fruits, 4 staples) to meet nutrient targets (~104 g/day protein, ~9–10.4 g/day leucine, ~449–899 mg/day flavonoids) for 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners). Quantities are calculated based on Plan B’s simplified menu, with costs estimated from ASDA pricing (June 2025, converted to USD).

### Protein Sources
- **Eggs**: 70 medium eggs (~$15.75, 3 x 30, ASDA Dairy Aisle).
  - Provides ~30 g protein, ~2.5–3 g leucine, ~625 mg choline/5 eggs/meal, supporting mTOR and sleep regulation.
- **Tinned Sardines/Mackerel**: 10 x 125 g cans (~$12.50, ASDA International Aisle, Wild Planet, bone-in).
  - Provides ~25 g protein, ~1.8–2.0 g leucine, ~400 IU vitamin D, ~1.72–3.43 g omega-3s/100 g, supporting mTOR and nerve health.
- **Beef (Lean Ground)**: 80 g (~$0.48, ASDA Fresh Meat Aisle).
  - Provides ~2 g protein, ~0.2 g leucine/10 g, used sparingly (2 meals) to enhance leucine without chicken-related constipation.

### Vegetables
- **Broccoli**: 1400 g (~$2.80, ASDA Fresh Produce).
  - Provides ~2.5 g fiber, ~316 mg potassium, ~0.5 mg alpha-lipoic acid/100 g, low-oxalate.
- **Romaine Lettuce**: 1400 g (~$2.80, ASDA Fresh Produce).
  - Provides ~2 g fiber, ~250 mg potassium/100 g, low-histamine.
- **Parsley**: 420 g (~$2.10, ASDA Fresh Produce).
  - Provides ~0.3 g fiber, ~10–20 mg flavonoids/10 g, low-histamine, used generously for flavonoid boost.

### Fruits
- **Kiwi**: 2100 g (~$7.35, ASDA Fresh Produce).
  - Provides ~3 g fiber, ~450 mg potassium, ~10–20 mg flavonoids/150 g, low-oxalate.
- **Strawberries**: 1400 g (~$7.00, ASDA Fresh Produce).
  - Provides ~2 g fiber, ~153 mg potassium, ~20 mg flavonoids/100 g, low-histamine.

### Staples
- **Lactose-Free Milk**: 1400 ml (~$2.80, ASDA Dairy Aisle, Arla Lactofree).
  - Provides ~3.6 g protein, ~120 mg calcium, ~800 IU vitamin D/100 ml/meal.
- **Fortified Oat Milk**: 1400 ml (~$2.80, ASDA Dairy-Free Aisle, Oatly).
  - Provides ~1 g protein, ~120 mg calcium, ~44 IU vitamin D/100 ml/meal.
- **Pumpkin Seeds**: 210 g (~$2.73, ASDA Whole Foods Aisle).
  - Provides ~1 g fiber, ~45 mg magnesium/15 g/meal, no soaking required for simplicity.
- **Green Tea**: 28 bags (~$1.50, ASDA Tea Aisle).
  - Provides ~200–400 mg EGCG/200 ml/meal, supports dementia prevention.

### Total Estimated Cost
- **Range**: ~$92.70–$103.80, reflecting adjustments (increased eggs, beef, kiwi, parsley) from original ~$81.59–$92.69, depending on ASDA pricing fluctuations.
- **Budget Notes**: ~$0–$5.10 remaining for contingencies (e.g., price increases, substitutions) ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Storage (June 4 Delivery to June 25–July 1)**:
  - **Protein Sources**: Refrigerate eggs, fish at 35–40°F; freeze beef (~80 g) in freezer bags at 0°F. Consume within 24 hours of cooking to minimize histamine ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
  - **Vegetables/Fruits**: Refrigerate broccoli, lettuce, kiwi, strawberries, parsley at 35–40°F.
  - **Staples**: Refrigerate milk at 35–40°F; store seeds, green tea at 50–70°F.
- **Preparation**:
  - Simplified prep: No soaking (unlike Plan A’s lentils/tofu); boil eggs/fish, sauté beef, steam broccoli, serve lettuce/kiwi/strawberries/parsley raw. Consume within 24 hours ([Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md)).
  - Prioritize eggs, fish for leucine and omega-3s; use beef sparingly (2 meals) for leucine boost.
- **Sourcing**: All items available at ASDA, with alternatives (e.g., Tesco, Sainsbury’s). Verify availability for June 3, 2025, order.
- **Comparison to Plan A**: Plan A’s list includes 33 items (~$128.93–$137.68, 18 foods, e.g., tofu, liver, lentils), requiring complex prep (soaking, roasting). Plan B’s 12 items (~$92.70–$103.80, 10 foods) reduce cost, complexity, and histamine risk, with higher flavonoids ([Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track purchases via receipts; monitor symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** to adjust sourcing if needed ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Customization**: Swap strawberries for oranges (~$2.50/1000 g) if bloating; replace kiwi with blackberries (~$2.25/225 g) if unavailable; ensure substitutions maintain flavonoids (~449–899 mg/day) ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).
