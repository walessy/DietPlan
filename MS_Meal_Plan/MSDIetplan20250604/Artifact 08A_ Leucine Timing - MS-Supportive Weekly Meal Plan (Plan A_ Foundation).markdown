# Artifact 08A: Leucine Timing - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 08A: Leucine Timing (Plan A: Foundation)**, detailing leucine and protein timing strategies for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan A, the foundation plan, delivers ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to cognitive concerns, minimal chicken). This document outlines how leucine timing enhances mTOR-driven protein synthesis for brain-muscle connection, synergizes with flavonoids for neuroprotection, and aligns with circadian rhythms to support MS symptom management (e.g., fatigue, spasticity, neuropathy). **Plan B** has adjusted leucine timing strategies (see **Artifact_08B_LeucineTiming_PlanB.md**).

## Leucine and Protein Timing Strategies

Leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, is critical for activating the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which regulates protein synthesis, muscle maintenance, and neural plasticity, supporting the brain-muscle connection in MS ([Muscle Nerve, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6039135/)). Plan A delivers ~115 g/day protein (~1.6 g/kg) and ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine through two meals/day, timed to optimize mTOR activity and circadian alignment while ensuring compatibility with low-histamine, low-oxalate, low-antinutrient requirements.

### Leucine Timing
- **Target Intake**: ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine (~4.8–6.1 g/meal, 2 meals/day).
  - **Rationale**: A threshold of ~2.5–3 g leucine/meal maximizes mTOR activation for protein synthesis, critical for muscle-nerve communication in MS ([J Nutr, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4791524/)). Plan A exceeds this threshold per meal to support neural repair and reduce spasticity.
  - **Sources**:
    - **Eggs**: ~2.0–2.4 g leucine/4 eggs/meal (all 14 meals).
    - **Tinned Sardines/Mackerel**: ~1.8–2.0 g leucine/100 g (10 meals: Wed–Fri, Mon–Tue lunches, Wed, Fri, Mon–Tue dinners).
    - **Turkey Breast**: ~2.0–2.2 g leucine/100 g (1 dinner, Thu).
    - **Chicken**: ~2.0–2.2 g leucine/100 g (4 dinners: Thu, Sat, Sun, Tue).
    - **Tofu**: ~1.5 g leucine/100 g (7 meals: Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun, Tue lunches, Fri dinner).
    - **Chicken Liver**: ~1.0–1.2 g leucine/50 g (1 dinner, Wed).
    - **Lactose-Free Milk**: ~0.3 g leucine/100 ml (all meals).
    - **Fortified Oat Milk**: ~0.1 g leucine/100 ml (all meals).
    - **Nutritional Yeast, Lentils, Seeds**: Minimal leucine (~0.1–0.2 g/portion, various meals).
  - **Meal Contribution**: Each meal provides ~4.8–6.1 g leucine (e.g., ~2.0–2.4 g from eggs, ~1.8–2.2 g from fish/turkey/chicken/tofu/liver, ~0.4 g from milk/oat milk), ensuring consistent mTOR stimulation ([Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md)).
- **Timing Strategy**:
  - **12:00 PM (Lunch)**: Delivers ~4.8–6.1 g leucine during peak metabolic activity, aligning with circadian rhythms to maximize protein synthesis and energy utilization ([Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md)).
  - **7:30–8:00 PM (Dinner)**: Provides ~4.8–6.1 g leucine within the 16:8 fasting window (12:00 PM–8:00 PM), supporting overnight muscle repair while avoiding late-night mTOR overstimulation that disrupts melatonin production ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
  - **Fasting Period (8:00 PM–12:00 PM)**: 16-hour fast reduces mTOR activity to promote autophagy, balancing daytime mTOR activation and supporting neural repair during sleep ([Artifact_12A_mTORAutophagy_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_12A_mTORAutophagy_PlanA.md)).

### Integration with Plan A Goals
- **mTOR Activation**: Leucine doses (~4.8–6.1 g/meal) stimulate mTOR for protein synthesis, enhancing brain-muscle connection and reducing MS-related spasticity and weakness. Meals are spaced (~7.5 hours apart) to sustain mTOR activity without desensitization ([Muscle Nerve, 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6039135/)).
- **Flavonoid Synergy**: Flavonoids (~124.57–240.39 mg/meal from strawberries, blueberries, parsley, green tea) reduce neuroinflammation, complementing leucine-driven neural repair and supporting dementia prevention ([Artifact_16A_FlavonoidsDementia_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_16A_FlavonoidsDementia_PlanA.md)).
- **Circadian Alignment**: Meal timing (12:00 PM, 7:30–8:00 PM) aligns with circadian metabolic peaks, enhancing leucine utilization and supporting melatonin production for sleep-mediated neural recovery ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
- **Food Compatibility**: Leucine-rich foods (eggs, fish, turkey) are low-histamine, low-oxalate, and low-antinutrient when prepared properly (e.g., consumed within 24 hours, soaked tofu/lentils), minimizing MS symptom exacerbation ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Nerve Health**: Leucine supports neural plasticity, synergizing with omega-3s (~0.86–1.72 g/meal from fish), B12 (~3.12 µg/meal), and choline (~250 mg/meal from eggs) to enhance nerve repair and reduce neuropathy ([Artifact_05A_NerveHealth_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_05A_NerveHealth_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Leucine Optimization**: Plan A’s ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine exceeds the ~2.5–3 g/meal threshold for mTOR activation, ensuring robust protein synthesis for MS-related muscle and nerve support. Timing within circadian-aligned meals maximizes efficacy ([J Nutr, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4791524/)).
- **Comparison to Plan B**: Plan B delivers ~9–10.4 g/day leucine (~4.4–5.3 g/meal) with simpler sources (eggs, beef), maintaining circadian timing but slightly lower leucine due to reduced protein variety ([Artifact_08B_LeucineTiming_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_08B_LeucineTiming_PlanB.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track leucine intake via **Cronometer** to ensure ~9.6–12.2 g/day; monitor muscle strength, spasticity, and fatigue (1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for strength) via **MySymptoms** to assess mTOR efficacy ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Customization**: If digestive issues occur, swap tofu/lentils with eggs/fish for equivalent leucine; adjust meal timing by ±30 minutes within the 16:8 window ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Ensure low-histamine preparation (consume within 24 hours, refrigerate 35–40°F) for leucine-rich foods (e.g., fish, liver); monitor vitamin A toxicity from liver (Wednesday dinner, aim <2 for symptoms) ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
