# Artifact 06: Shopping List - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 06: Shopping List - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)**, providing the shopping list for **Plan A**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan A is a comprehensive dietary approach with 18 foods, delivering ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids to support **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document lists ingredients, quantities, estimated costs, and sourcing guidance for the 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners) detailed in **Artifact_05_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md**. For an overview of Plan A and Plan B development, see **Artifact_01_IntroductionAndDevelopment.md**; for the project index, see **Artifact_02_TableOfContents.md**; for nutritional standards, see **Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md**; for the daily routine, see **Artifact_04_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md**.

## Shopping List Overview

- **Purpose**: Supports the 7-day menu for Plan A, ensuring all ingredients meet low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), and low-antinutrient criteria ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Quantity**: Covers 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners) for one person, with minimal waste.
- **Estimated Cost**: ~$141.13–$149.88, based on ASDA prices (June 2025, converted from GBP to USD at 1.27 USD/GBP), with alternatives from Tesco and Sainsbury’s ([Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md)).
- **Sourcing**: Prioritize fresh, high-quality ingredients; purchase by Tuesday, June 3, 2025, for delivery by Wednesday, June 4, 2025, to ensure freshness for the plan’s start.
- **Storage**: Refrigerate perishables at 35–40°F; consume within 24 hours post-preparation to minimize histamine ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
- **Substitutions**: Alternatives (e.g., blueberries for strawberries, rice for quinoa) maintain nutrient targets ([Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md)).

## Sourcing and Storage Guidelines
- **Sourcing**:
  - **Primary Retailer**: ASDA for cost efficiency; order online by Tuesday, June 3, 2025, for delivery by Wednesday, June 4, 2025 ([Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_16_FoodSourcing_PlanA.md)).
  - **Alternatives**: Tesco, Sainsbury’s for unavailable items; prioritize organic/fresh where budget allows (~10% cost increase).
  - **Quality**: Select fresh eggs (check expiration), firm tofu, ripe avocados, vibrant vegetables, and tinned fish in water (no additives). Verify SIGHI score 0–1 for all items.
- **Storage**:
  - **Refrigeration**: Store eggs, tinned fish (post-opening), tofu, oat milk, kale, zucchini, broccoli, strawberries, and blueberries at 35–40°F to prevent histamine formation.
  - **Dry Storage**: Keep quinoa, rice, green tea, and olive oil in cool, dry conditions; seal tightly to avoid oxidation.
  - **Preparation Timing**: Prepare meals daily or within 24 hours of cooking to minimize histamine; batch prep (e.g., boil quinoa for 2–3 days) is viable if refrigerated ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
- **Substitutions**: Use rice for quinoa, spinach for kale, or cauliflower for broccoli/zucchini if unavailable, ensuring nutrient equivalence ([Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md)).

## Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Tracking**: Use **Cronometer** to verify purchased ingredients meet nutrient targets (protein, leucine, flavonoids, calcium, potassium) from **Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md**; track symptoms (fatigue, bloating) with **MySymptoms** (1–10 scale, aim <2) ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Adjustments**: If items are unavailable, select substitutes from **Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md** (e.g., replace strawberries with raspberries). Adjust quantities for spoilage or preference while maintaining nutrient goals ([Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md)).
- **Budget Optimization**: Purchase in bulk (e.g., 5 dozen eggs) or opt for store brands to reduce costs; compare prices across ASDA, Tesco, Sainsbury’s ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Plan A Focus**: This shopping list supports Plan A’s comprehensive menu, requiring more ingredients than Plan B’s 13-item list ([Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **Safety**: All items meet low-histamine, low-oxalate, and low-antinutrient criteria, with storage and preparation guidelines to minimize risks ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Budget**: Total cost (~$141.13–$149.88) aligns with Plan A’s menu; cost-saving strategies reduce expenses without compromising quality ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Ingredients support the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals (e.g., blueberries, kale) ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
- **Shopping Timeline**: Order by June 3, 2025, for delivery by June 4, 2025, ensuring freshness for the plan’s start on June 25, 2025.
