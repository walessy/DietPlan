# Artifact 15B: Simplified Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 15B: Simplified Menu (Plan B: Derivative)**, providing a concise overview of a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan B, a derivative of Plan A (see **Artifact_15A_SimplifiedMenu_PlanA.md**), is simplified for cost, complexity, and histamine risk, adjusted for **increased mTOR activity** (~104 g/day protein, ~1.45 g/kg), **leucine** (~9–10.4 g/day), and **flavonoids** (~449–899 mg/day) to strengthen brain-muscle connection and reduce dementia risk, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no chicken). The menu delivers ~104 g/day protein, ~9–10.4 g/day leucine, ~449–899 mg/day flavonoids across two meals (12:00 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, optimizing **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, and **telomeres**. Shopping was ordered on June 3, 2025, for delivery on June 4, 2025 (~$92.70–$103.80).

### Notes
- **Mitochondrial Health**: Plan B delivers cofactors (thiamine ~1.2 mg/day, B12 ~5.5 µg/day, vitamin D ~2600–3700 IU/day) for **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, flavonoids (~449–899 mg/day) for **mitophagy** and **sirtuin** activation, and alpha-lipoic acid (broccoli) to balance **mTOR activity**, supporting MS energy and cognition ([Artifact_14A_MitochondrialStrategies_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_14A_MitochondrialStrategies_PlanA.md)).
- **MS Symptom Management**: Fiber (~37 g/day) alleviates constipation; vitamin D reduces relapse risk; flavonoids and omega-3s (~1.72–3.43 g/day from fish) mitigate spasticity and cognitive decline; choline (~625 mg/day from eggs) supports alertness/sleep; B12 and iron (~10.5 mg/day) reduce fatigue and neuropathy; no chicken avoids constipation ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Preparation and Storage**: Simplified prep (no soaking, unlike Plan A); boil eggs/fish, sauté beef, steam broccoli, serve lettuce/kiwi/strawberries/parsley raw; consume/refrigerate within 24 hours; freeze beef; refrigerate eggs, fish, vegetables, fruits, milk at 35–40°F; store seeds, tea at 50–70°F ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Cook to 165°F; monitor histamine reactions (1–10 scale, aim <2) in **MySymptoms**; avoid high-histamine/oxalate foods ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Budget of ~$92.70–$103.80, with ~$0–$5.10 remaining ([Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **Customization**: Swap strawberries with oranges (~$2.50/1000 g) if bloating; replace kiwi with blackberries (~$2.25/225 g) if unavailable; ensure substitutions maintain flavonoids (~449–899 mg/day) ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).
