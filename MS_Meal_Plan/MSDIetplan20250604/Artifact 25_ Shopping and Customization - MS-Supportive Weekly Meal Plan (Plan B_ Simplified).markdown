# Artifact 25: Shopping and Customization - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Simplified)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 25: Shopping and Customization - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Simplified)**, providing guidance for shopping and customizing ingredients for **Plan B**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan B is a simplified dietary approach using 9 foods to deliver approximately 111 g/day protein, 10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, and 419–839 mg/day flavonoids, supporting **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document outlines strategies to source Plan B’s ingredients and customize the menu to accommodate availability, preferences, or symptom triggers while meeting nutritional targets. For the shopping list, see **Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md**; for nutritional standards, see **Artifact_22_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md**; for the detailed menu, see **Artifact_23_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md**; for Plan A’s customization, see **Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md**.

## Shopping and Customization Overview

- **Purpose**: To ensure Plan B’s 9 core ingredients (eggs, tinned sardines, tofu, avocado, zucchini, kale, blueberries, fortified oat milk, green tea) and 4 optional substitutes (rice, spinach, cauliflower, flaxseed oil) are sourced reliably and customized to maintain **low-histamine** (SIGHI score 0–1), **low-oxalate** (<10 mg/100 g), and **low-antinutrient** standards, meeting nutrient targets (~55.6 g protein, ~5.2–6.0 g leucine, ~209.5–419.5 mg flavonoids per meal) within a budget of ~$99.63–$112.76 (without optionals).
- **Shopping Goals**:
  - Source ingredients from ASDA (primary retailer) or alternatives (Tesco, Sainsbury’s, local markets) by June 3, 2025, for delivery by June 4, 2025.
  - Verify freshness, quality, and compliance with MS dietary requirements.
- **Customization Goals**:
  - Adapt the menu for ingredient availability, taste preferences, or symptom triggers (e.g., bloating >2 from kale).
  - Maintain nutritional balance and dietary constraints through substitutions or portion adjustments.
- **Monitoring**: Use **Cronometer** to track nutrients and **MySymptoms** to monitor symptoms (1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition/sleep) to validate customization efficacy ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).

## Shopping Guidelines

### 1. Primary Retailer: ASDA
- **Rationale**: ASDA offers competitive prices (~$99.63–$112.76 for Plan B) and reliable availability for Plan B’s 9 core and 4 optional ingredients, aligning with the budget ([Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **Implementation**:
  - **Ordering**: Access asda.com by June 3, 2025, to order for delivery by June 4, 2025; select the cheapest delivery slot (~$3–$5).
  - **Ingredient Selection**:
    - Eggs: ASDA Free Range Large Eggs, 12-pack (~$2.54, 3.5 packs for 42 eggs).
    - Tinned Sardines: ASDA Sardines in Water, 100 g cans (~$1.27/can, 14 cans).
    - Tofu: ASDA Firm Tofu, 400 g (~$2.54/pack, 3.5 packs).
    - Avocado: ASDA Ripe Avocados (~$0.91/unit, 13 units).
    - Zucchini: ASDA Fresh Zucchini (~$0.45/100 g, 1400 g).
    - Kale: ASDA Fresh Kale, 200 g (~$1.27/pack, 2 packs).
    - Blueberries: ASDA Fresh Blueberries, 400 g (~$3.81/pack, 3.5 packs).
    - Oat Milk: ASDA Oat Milk, Fortified, 1 L (~$1.91/L, 5.6 L).
    - Green Tea: ASDA Loose Leaf Green Tea, 100 g (~$3.18, 0.5 pack).
    - Optionals: ASDA White Basmati Rice (500 g, ~$1.27), Spinach (200 g, ~$1.27), Cauliflower (200 g, ~$1.27), Flaxseed Oil (250 ml, ~$1.91).
  - **Verification**: Confirm SIGHI score 0–1, no additives, and freshness (e.g., firm zucchini, expiry >2026 for sardines) via product descriptions or labels upon delivery.
- **Monitoring**: Log delivery quality in **MySymptoms**; report spoilage (e.g., bruised blueberries, histamine >2) to ASDA for refunds ([Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md)).

### 2. Alternative Retailers
- **Rationale**: Tesco, Sainsbury’s, or local markets ensure availability if ASDA stocks are low or quality is suboptimal (e.g., fresher kale), maintaining Plan B’s dietary standards.
- **Implementation**:
  - **Tesco (tesco.com)**:
    - Check for eggs, tinned sardines, tofu, and produce; prices ~5–10% higher (e.g., Tesco Blueberries, 400 g ~$4.18 vs. ASDA $3.81).
    - Order by June 3, 2025, for delivery by June 4, 2025; verify SIGHI score 0–1.
  - **Sainsbury’s (sainsburys.co.uk)**:
    - Ideal for organic produce (e.g., Sainsbury’s Organic Kale, 200 g ~$1.59) or oat milk; prices ~10–15% higher (e.g., Tofu ~$2.86 vs. ASDA $2.54).
    - Same ordering timeline; confirm no additives.
  - **Local Markets**:
    - Source fresh blueberries, zucchini, kale (harvested within 3–5 days) for lower cost (~$0.64/100 g blueberries vs. ASDA $0.95) and quality.
    - Visit by June 3, 2025; negotiate bulk discounts (e.g., 1400 g blueberries ~$8.96).
  - **Verification**: Check labels for SIGHI score 0–1, low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g); inspect produce for vibrancy, no blemishes.
- **Monitoring**: Log alternative purchases in **Cronometer** notes; track symptoms (e.g., bloating >2) to confirm quality ([Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md)).

### 3. Cost Optimization
- **Rationale**: Staying within ~$99.63–$112.76 requires strategic sourcing to balance quality and affordability for MS patients ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).
- **Implementation**:
  - **Bulk Purchasing**: Buy eggs (5 dozen, ~$10.16 vs. 3.5 dozen ~$8.89), tinned sardines (case of 24 cans, ~$28.58 vs. 14 cans ~$17.78), saving ~$0.15–$0.25/unit.
  - **Store Brands**: Use ASDA Oat Milk (~$1.91/L vs. Alpro ~$2.29, saving ~$2.13) and Green Tea (~$3.18/100 g vs. Twinings ~$3.81, saving ~$0.63).
  - **Seasonal Produce**: Source blueberries, zucchini, kale at markets in June (~$0.38–$0.64/100 g vs. ASDA ~$0.45–$0.95, saving ~$3–$7).
  - **Loyalty Programs**: Apply ASDA Rewards (~1% cashback, ~$1/week), Tesco Clubcard (~5% off sardines), or Sainsbury’s Nectar (~0.5% back) to reduce costs.
- **Monitoring**: Track costs in a spreadsheet; if >$112.76, prioritize store brands or reduce optional purchases (~$3.51 savings) ([Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md)).

## Customization Guidelines

### 1. Ingredient Substitutions
- **Rationale**: Substitutions address availability, taste, or symptom triggers (e.g., histamine >2 from sardines) while maintaining nutrient targets ([Artifact_22_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_22_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md)).
- **Options**:
  - **Eggs (3 eggs/meal, ~18 g protein)**:
    - **Substitute**: Increase tofu to 200 g/meal (~20 g protein, ~1.4 g leucine) if eggs unavailable or cholesterol concern (~744 mg/day); monitor lipids with nutritionist.
    - **Reason**: Maintains protein/leucine; SIGHI score 0, low-oxalate (~2–5 mg/100 g).
  - **Tinned Sardines (100 g/meal, ~25 g protein, ~1–2 g omega-3s)**:
    - **Substitute**: Increase eggs to 4/meal (~24 g protein, ~2 g leucine) or tofu to 150 g/meal (~15 g protein) if histamine >2 or unavailable.
    - **Reason**: Preserves protein; eggs lack omega-3s, so add 15 ml flaxseed oil (~2 g ALA).
  - **Tofu (100 g/meal, ~350 mg calcium)**:
    - **Substitute**: Increase oat milk to 500 g/meal (~600 mg calcium) or kale to 60 g/meal (~90 mg calcium) if tofu causes bloating >2.
    - **Reason**: Maintains calcium; oat milk/kale SIGHI score 0, low-oxalate.
  - **Avocado (90 g/meal, ~13.5 g fats)**:
    - **Substitute**: 15 ml flaxseed oil (~14 g fats, ~2 g ALA) if avocados overripe (histamine risk) or costly.
    - **Reason**: Preserves fats/omega-3s; SIGHI score 0, negligible oxalate.
  - **Zucchini (100 g/meal, ~261 mg potassium)**:
    - **Substitute**: 100 g cauliflower (~150 mg potassium) if zucchini unavailable or bloating >2.
    - **Reason**: Maintains potassium; SIGHI score 0, low-oxalate (~1 mg/100 g).
  - **Kale (27.9 g/meal, ~15–30 mg flavonoids)**:
    - **Substitute**: 30 g spinach (~15 mg flavonoids, ~30 mg calcium) if kale causes bloating >2.
    - **Reason**: Preserves flavonoids; SIGHI score 0, low-oxalate post-steaming (~2 mg/100 g).
  - **Blueberries (100 g/meal, ~25–50 mg flavonoids)**:
    - **Substitute**: Increase green tea to 300 ml/meal (~150–300 mg flavonoids) if blueberries unavailable or costly.
    - **Reason**: Maintains flavonoids; SIGHI score 0, low-oxalate (~1–2 mg/200 ml).
- **Verification**: Log substitutions in **Cronometer** to confirm nutrient targets (~55.6 g protein, ~209.5–419.5 mg flavonoids/meal); track symptoms in **MySymptoms** (aim <2) ([Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md)).

### 2. Portion Adjustments
- **Rationale**: Adjusting portions addresses nutrient gaps (e.g., protein <111 g/day) or symptoms (e.g., bloating >2) while maintaining dietary constraints.
- **Options**:
  - **Protein/Leucine Shortfall (<111 g/day, <10.4 g/day)**:
    - Increase sardines to 150 g/meal (~37.5 g protein, ~2.7 g leucine) or tofu to 150 g/meal (~15 g protein, ~1.05 g leucine).
    - Monitor cost (~$1.27 extra/meal for sardines) and histamine (consume within 24 hours).
  - **Calcium Shortfall (<1800 mg/day)**:
    - Increase oat milk to 450 g/meal (~540 mg calcium) or tofu to 150 g/meal (~525 mg calcium).
    - Ensure SIGHI score 0; track spasticity (<2).
  - **Potassium Shortfall (<4376 mg/day)**:
    - Increase avocado to 120 g/meal (~582 mg potassium) or zucchini to 150 g/meal (~391 mg potassium).
    - Verify low-oxalate (~2 mg/100 g zucchini); monitor fatigue (<2).
  - **Flavonoids Shortfall (<419 mg/day)**:
    - Increase blueberries to 150 g/meal (~37.5–75 mg flavonoids) or green tea to 250 ml/meal (~125–250 mg flavonoids).
    - Confirm SIGHI score 0; track cognition (>7).
  - **Bloating/Histamine (>2)**:
    - Reduce kale to 15 g/meal (~7.5–15 mg flavonoids) or sardines to 50 g/meal (~12.5 g protein, ~0.9 g leucine); supplement with tofu (150 g) or eggs (4/meal).
    - Monitor symptoms 1–2 hours post-meal; ensure freshness (consume within 24 hours).
- **Verification**: Use **Cronometer** to confirm adjusted nutrient targets; log changes in **MySymptoms** to track symptom impact ([Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md)).

### 3. Preparation Modifications
- **Rationale**: Altering preparation methods enhances digestibility, reduces histamine/antinutrients, or accommodates preferences while preserving nutrients ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
- **Options**:
  - **Bloating (>2)**:
    - Steam zucchini/kale longer (10–12 min vs. 8–10 min) or boil tofu (10 min) to reduce fiber/phytates; monitor digestion 1–2 hours post-meal.
  - **Histamine (>2)**:
    - Serve sardines cold (drained, no heating) or boil lightly (3–5 min); consume within 24 hours post-opening to minimize histamine.
  - **Nutrient Retention**:
    - Steam tofu briefly (6–8 min vs. 8–10 min) to preserve calcium; serve blueberries raw to retain flavonoids.
  - **Taste Variety**:
    - Rotate egg preparation (hard-boiled, scrambled, poached) or tofu (steamed, sautéed in 5 ml olive oil) weekly; ensure cooking to 165°F for safety.
- **Verification**: Log preparation changes in **MySymptoms**; track symptoms (e.g., bloating <2) and nutrients in **Cronometer** to confirm efficacy.

## Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Tracking**:
  - Use **Cronometer** to verify nutrient intake post-substitution or portion change (e.g., ~55.6 g protein, ~209.5–419.5 mg flavonoids/meal) ([Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md)).
  - Monitor symptoms in **MySymptoms** (post-meal at 1:30 PM, 9:00 PM; daily at 6:30 AM, 9:30 PM) to assess customization impact (aim <2, >7 for cognition/sleep) ([Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md)).
- **Adjustments**:
  - If nutrients fall short (e.g., calcium <1800 mg/day), increase oat milk to 450 g/meal or source tofu from Tesco if ASDA quality is poor.
  - If symptoms worsen (e.g., histamine >2 post-sardines), switch to eggs (4/meal) or ensure fresher stock from markets.
  - If budget exceeds ~$112.76, use store brands or reduce optionals (~$3.51 savings) ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).
- **Consultation**: Share Cronometer/MySymptoms data with a nutritionist by July 1, 2025, to evaluate customization efficacy and adjust for long-term MS management ([Artifact_20_LongTermPlanning_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_20_LongTermPlanning_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Plan B Focus**: This artifact streamlines shopping and customization for Plan B’s 9-food menu, requiring less complexity than Plan A’s 32-ingredient approach ([Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: All shopping and customization strategies ensure **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** compliance, critical for MS symptom management ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Budget**: Strategies align with Plan B’s budget (~$99.63–$112.76 without optionals), offering cost-effective alternatives ([Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Customization supports the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals by preserving flavonoid and omega-3 intake ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
- **Usability**: Guidelines are practical, accommodating MS patients with limited energy or cognitive capacity.
- **ZIP Request**: Your prior request for a ZIP file for Windows ([message](#message-4327a6b3-0da6-4db9-95c3-b99b88abf635]) included **Artifact_25** as a fully output artifact. This output confirms the content. Confirm if an updated ZIP or alternative delivery (e.g., cloud link) is needed.
