# Artifact 02A: Nutritional Standards - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 02A: Nutritional Standards (Plan A: Foundation)**, outlining the nutritional standards for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan A delivers ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, with circadian alignment, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal chicken). This document establishes nutrient targets to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **circadian health**. **Plan B** has adjusted standards (see **Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md**). For menu, see **Artifact_15A_SimplifiedMenu_PlanA.md**; for shopping, see **Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**; for tracking, see **Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md**; for circadian health, see **Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md**.

## Nutritional Standards

The following standards are based on UK Reference Nutrient Intakes (RNIs), MS-specific research, and user preferences, ensuring cofactors for mitochondrial function, mTOR activation, and circadian alignment ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

## Notes
- **Alignment with Plan A**: Standards support Plan A’s comprehensive menu (18 foods), ensuring mitochondrial cofactors, mTOR/leucine for brain-muscle connection, flavonoids for dementia prevention, and circadian alignment via meal timing and light exposure ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan B**: Plan B adjusts to ~104 g/day protein, ~9–10.4 g/day leucine, ~449–899 mg/day flavonoids, ~630 µg RAE/day vitamin A, with higher flavonoid focus and simpler menu ([Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track nutrients via **Cronometer**, symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, sleep quality, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Monitor vitamin A toxicity (liver, nausea, headache, aim <2) due to ~2258.5 µg RAE/day exceeding UK UL; reduce liver if symptoms >2 ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
