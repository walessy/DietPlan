# Artifact 04A: Detailed Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 04A: Detailed Menu (Plan A: Foundation)**, providing a day-by-day menu for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan A, the foundation plan, delivers ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal chicken). The menu supports MS symptom management (fatigue, spasticity, cognition) through structured meal timing and nutrient-dense foods. **Plan B** has a simplified menu (see **Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md**). For nutritional standards, see **Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md**; for routine, see **Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md**; for shopping, see **Artifact_06A_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**; for tracking, see **Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md**; for circadian health, see **Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md**.

## Detailed Menu

The menu is structured for two meals daily (12:00 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, aligning with circadian rhythms to support melatonin production and metabolic health ([Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md)). Each meal provides ~57.5 g protein, ~4.8–6.1 g leucine, ~124.57–240.39 mg flavonoids, and other cofactors to meet Plan A’s nutritional standards ([Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md)). Preparation methods minimize histamine and antinutrients (e.g., soaking lentils/tofu/seeds, consuming within 24 hours).

## Notes
- **Circadian Alignment**: Meals at 12:00 PM and 7:30–8:00 PM align with circadian rhythms, supporting melatonin production and metabolic health, enhanced by red light exposure post-6:00 PM ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
- **Nutrient Consistency**: Each meal meets ~57.5 g protein, ~4.8–6.1 g leucine, ~124.57–240.39 mg flavonoids, ensuring mTOR activation, dementia prevention, and mitochondrial support ([Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan B**: Plan B’s menu uses 10 foods (~104 g/day protein, ~449–899 mg/day flavonoids) with simpler prep (e.g., eggs, beef, kiwi) but similar circadian timing ([Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track nutrient intake via **Cronometer**, symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, sleep, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)). Monitor vitamin A toxicity (Wednesday dinner, liver, aim <2).
- **Customization**: Swap high-histamine foods (liver, lentils, tofu) with turkey or eggs if reactions occur; adjust fruits (e.g., oranges for strawberries) if bloating ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Cook to 165°F; consume within 24 hours to minimize histamine; peel zucchini/cucumber to reduce antinutrients ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
