# Artifact 11: Meal Prep Guidelines - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 11: Meal Prep Guidelines - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)**, outlining meal preparation guidelines for **Plan A**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan A is a comprehensive dietary approach with 18 foods, delivering \~115 g/day protein, \~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and \~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids to support **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document provides detailed instructions for preparing, cooking, and storing Plan A’s 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners) to ensure food safety, nutrient retention, and compliance with MS-specific dietary requirements.

## Meal Prep Overview

- **Purpose**: To guide the preparation of Plan A’s 7-day menu (14 meals) to minimize histamine formation, reduce oxalates and antinutrients, retain nutrients, and ensure food safety, optimizing MS symptom management (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating).
- **Foods**: 18 ingredients (eggs, tinned sardines, tinned mackerel, tofu, avocado, zucchini, broccoli, kale, strawberries, blueberries, quinoa, fortified oat milk, green tea, olive oil, rice, spinach, cauliflower, flaxseed oil) from **Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**, prepared to meet low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (&lt;10 mg/100 g), and low-antinutrient criteria (Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md).
- **Schedule**: Meals prepared daily or in small batches (1–2 days) to align with the 16:8 fasting schedule (lunch at 12:00 PM, dinner at 7:30–8:00 PM) and ensure freshness (Artifact_04_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md).
- **Methods**: Boiling, steaming, sautéing, and minimal raw preparation to preserve nutrients and reduce histamine/antinutrients; consume within 24 hours of cooking.
- **Storage**: Refrigerate at 35–40°F; use airtight containers to prevent histamine accumulation; freeze only if necessary (e.g., excess quinoa, &lt;1 month).
- **Monitoring**: Track preparation adherence and symptoms (1–10 scale, aim &lt;2 for fatigue, bloating; &gt;7 for cognition) with **Cronometer** and **MySymptoms** to validate safety and efficacy (Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md).

## Preparation Guidelines

The following guidelines detail preparation, cooking, and storage for Plan A’s 18 foods, ensuring compliance with MS-specific dietary needs and the 7-day menu (Artifact_05_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md).

## Batch Preparation Strategies

- **Daily Prep (Preferred)**:
  - Prepare lunch (10:00 AM–12:00 PM) and dinner (6:00 PM–7:30 PM) ingredients daily to ensure freshness and minimize histamine, aligning with **Artifact_04_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md**.
  - Example: Morning (10:00 AM) – boil 3 eggs, steam 100 g zucchini, drain 100 g sardines; Evening (6:00 PM) – steam 100 g tofu, 30 g kale, prepare 100 g avocado.
- **Small Batch Prep (1–2 Days)**:
  - Prep 2–4 meals at once (e.g., 2 lunches, 2 dinners) if time-constrained; refrigerate at 35–40°F and consume within 24 hours.
  - Example: Sunday AM – boil 12 eggs, steam 400 g zucchini, boil 200 g quinoa for 4 meals; refrigerate and use by Monday PM.
  - **Quinoa/Rice**: Boil 200 g (4 meals) at once, store at 35–40°F, reheat (microwave 30 seconds) or serve cold within 2 days.
  - **Vegetables**: Steam 200 g zucchini/broccoli/cauliflower or 120 g kale/spinach for 2–4 meals; refrigerate and consume within 24 hours.
- **Freezing (Limited)**:
  - Freeze cooked quinoa or rice (200 g portions) if excess; thaw at 35–40°F and consume within 24 hours. Avoid freezing eggs, tinned fish, tofu, or vegetables (histamine risk).
- **Safety**: Label containers with prep date/time; discard food &gt;24 hours post-cooking (except dry goods or unopened tinned fish) to ensure low histamine (Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md).

## Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Tracking**: Use **Cronometer** to verify nutrient retention post-preparation (e.g., \~57.5 g protein, \~4.8–6.1 g leucine per meal); track symptoms (fatigue, bloating, cognition, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim &lt;2, &gt;7 for cognition) with **MySymptoms** to assess preparation impact (Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md).
- **Adjustments**: If symptoms arise (e.g., bloating &gt;2 after kale), modify preparation (e.g., steam kale 3–5 min vs. 5–7 min) or substitute (e.g., spinach) per **Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md**. If nutrient loss occurs (e.g., calcium &lt;1800 mg/day), increase oat milk to 450 g/meal (Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md).
- **Consultation**: Share preparation logs and symptom data with a nutritionist by July 1, 2025, to evaluate safety (e.g., histamine control) and nutrient adequacy; consider supplements if gaps persist (Artifact_14_SupplementRecommendations_PlanA.md).

## Notes

- **Plan A Focus**: These guidelines support Plan A’s comprehensive menu, requiring more complex preparation than Plan B’s simpler approach (Artifact_23_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md).
- **Safety**: All preparation methods minimize histamine, oxalate, and antinutrient risks, critical for MS symptom management (J Neurol., 2019).
- **Budget**: Preparation aligns with Plan A’s budget (\~$141.13–$149.88), using efficient methods to reduce waste (Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md).
- **MIND Variant**: Guidelines support the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals by preserving flavonoids in fruits and vegetables (\[Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md\](https://github
