# Artifact 02B: Nutritional Standards - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 02B: Nutritional Standards (Plan B: Derivative)**, outlining the nutritional standards for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan B, a derivative of Plan A (see **Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md**), is simplified for cost, complexity, and histamine risk, adjusted for **increased mTOR activity** (~104 g/day protein, ~1.45 g/kg), **leucine** (~9–10.4 g/day), and **flavonoids** (~449–899 mg/day) to strengthen brain-muscle connection and reduce dementia risk, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no chicken). Shopping was ordered on June 3, 2025, for delivery on June 4, 2025 (~$92.70–$103.80). This document establishes nutrient targets to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, and **circadian alignment**. For menu, see **Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md**; for shopping, see **Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md**; for tracking, see **Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md** (shared with Plan A).

## Nutritional Standards

The following standards are based on UK Reference Nutrient Intakes (RNIs), MS-specific research, and user preferences, adjusted from Plan A to simplify sourcing and preparation while meeting mitochondrial and cognitive health needs ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

### Macronutrients
- **Protein**: ~104 g/day (~1.45 g/kg, ~52 g/meal, 2 meals/day).

  - Sources: Eggs (~30 g/5 eggs/meal), tinned fish (~25 g/100 g), beef (~2 g/10 g), milk (~3.6 g/100 ml), oat milk (~1 g/100 ml), parsley (~0.3 g/10 g).

  - Alleviates constipation, supports gut health.
  - Sources: Broccoli (~2.5 g/100 g), romaine lettuce (~2 g/100 g), kiwi (~3 g/150 g), strawberries (~2 g/100 g), parsley (~0.3 g/10 g), seeds (~1–4.5 g/10–15 g).

### Micronutrients

  - Supports bone health, nerve signaling.
  - Sources: Fish (~250 mg/100 g), broccoli (~47 mg/100 g), lettuce (~33 mg/100 g), milk (~120 mg/100 ml), oat milk (~120 mg/100 ml), eggs (~37.5 mg/5 eggs), parsley (~14 mg/10 g).
- **Vitamin D**: ~2600–3700 IU/day (~1300–1850 IU/meal, meets MS needs ~2000–4000 IU/day).
  - Reduces relapse risk, supports immune function.
  - Sources: Fish (~400 IU/100 g), milk (~800 IU/100 ml), oat milk (~44 IU/100 ml), sun exposure (~500–1000 IU).
- **Thiamine (B1)**: ~1.2 mg/day (~0.6 mg/meal, above UK RNI 1.0 mg/day).
  - Supports mitochondrial energy production.
  - Sources: Broccoli (~0.1 mg/100 g), seeds (~0.3 mg/10–15 g), eggs (~0.05 mg/5 eggs).
- **Vitamin A**: ~630 µg RAE/day (~315 µg RAE/meal, below UK UL 1500 µg/day).
  - Supports vision, immune function, avoids toxicity risk from Plan A’s liver.
  - Sources: Eggs (~400 µg/5 eggs), broccoli (~60 µg/100 g), parsley (~84 µg/10 g), milk (~100 µg/100 ml).
- **Vitamin B12**: ~5.5 µg/day (~2.75 µg/meal, above UK RNI 1.5 µg/day).
  - Reduces fatigue, neuropathy.
  - Sources: Eggs (~2.5 µg/5 eggs), fish (~1.29 µg/100 g), milk (~0.5 µg/100 ml), oat milk (~0.38 µg/100 ml).

- **Choline**: ~625 mg/day (~312.5 mg/meal).
  - Supports acetylcholine synthesis, sleep regulation.
  - Source: Eggs (~625 mg/5 eggs/meal).

## Notes
- **Alignment with Plan B**: Standards support Plan B’s simplified menu (10 foods: eggs, tinned fish, beef, broccoli, lettuce, kiwi, strawberries, green tea, parsley, seeds), ensuring mitochondrial cofactors, mTOR/leucine for brain-muscle connection, and flavonoids for dementia prevention, with reduced complexity and histamine risk compared to Plan A ([Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan A**: Plan A delivers ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, ~2258.5 µg RAE/day vitamin A, with more variety (18 foods, including tofu, liver, lentils) but higher cost and complexity (~$128.93–$137.68). Plan B reduces protein (~104 g/day), vitamin A (~630 µg RAE/day) to avoid toxicity, and increases flavonoids (~449–899 mg/day) for enhanced cognitive protection ([Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track nutrients via **Cronometer**, symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)). Monitor flavonoid intake (~449–899 mg/day) to ensure dementia prevention benefits.
- **Safety**: Avoid vitamin A toxicity (no liver, unlike Plan A); ensure low-histamine preparation (consume within 24 hours, refrigerate 35–40°F) for fish and eggs ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
