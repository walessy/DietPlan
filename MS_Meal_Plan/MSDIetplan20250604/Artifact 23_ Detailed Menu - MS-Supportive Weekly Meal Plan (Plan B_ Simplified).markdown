# Artifact 23: Detailed Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Simplified)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 23: Detailed Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Simplified)**, providing a detailed 7-day menu for **Plan B** (June 25–July 1, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan B is a simplified dietary approach using 9 foods to deliver approximately 111 g/day protein, 10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, and 419–839 mg/day flavonoids, supporting **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document outlines 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners) with nutrient breakdowns, preparation notes, and storage guidelines to manage MS symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, neuropathy, bloating, histamine reactions). For nutritional standards, see **Artifact_22_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md**; for the shopping list, see **Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md**; for customization options, see **Artifact_25_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanB.md**; for Plan A’s menu, see **Artifact_05_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md**.

## Menu Overview

- **Purpose**: To provide a simplified, nutrient-dense 7-day menu (14 meals) that meets Plan B’s nutritional targets (~55.6 g protein, ~5.2–6.0 g leucine, ~209.5–419.5 mg flavonoids per meal) while minimizing preparation effort and cost (~$99.63–$112.76 without optionals) for MS symptom management.
- **Foods**: 9 core ingredients (eggs, tinned sardines, tofu, avocado, zucchini, kale, blueberries, fortified oat milk, green tea), with optional substitutes (rice, spinach, cauliflower, flaxseed oil) for flexibility ([Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **Schedule**: Two meals/day (lunch at 12:00 PM, dinner at 7:30–8:00 PM) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting window (eating window: 12:00 PM–8:00 PM) to align with circadian rhythms ([Artifact_15_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_15_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
- **Preparation**: Emphasizes steaming, boiling, and minimal raw preparation to reduce histamine and antinutrients; consume within 24 hours, store at 35–40°F ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track nutrients with **Cronometer** and symptoms (1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition/sleep) with **MySymptoms** to verify efficacy ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).

Monitor with **Cronometer** to meet targets (~111 g/day protein, ~10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids) per **Artifact_22_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md** ([message](#message-a1bfaaea-3613-4d21-9ff2-7c0ec6bf9488)).

## Preparation and Storage Notes
- **Preparation**:
  - **Eggs**: Rotate hard-boiled (10–12 min), scrambled (3–5 min), or poached (3–4 min) for variety; cook to 165°F to minimize histamine ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
  - **Tinned Sardines**: Drain thoroughly; serve cold or boil lightly (3–5 min) to warm without increasing histamine.
  - **Tofu**: Steam (8–10 min) or sauté (5–7 min in 5 ml olive oil) for texture; ensure firm tofu for low antinutrients.
  - **Avocado/Blueberries**: Serve raw; rinse blueberries to reduce histamine; slice avocado just before serving.
  - **Zucchini/Kale**: Steam zucchini (8–10 min), kale (5–7 min) to reduce oxalates (~2 mg/100 g zucchini, ~0.5–2 mg/30 g kale) and phytates.
  - **Oat Milk/Green Tea**: Shake oat milk, serve cold or warm (<165°F); brew green tea at 80–85°C (2–3 min) to maximize flavonoids (~100–200 mg/200 ml).
- **Storage**:
  - Refrigerate all prepared foods at 35–40°F in airtight containers; consume within 24 hours to prevent histamine accumulation.
  - Store unopened tinned sardines at room temperature; refrigerate opened cans and consume within 24 hours.
  - Keep dry goods (e.g., optional rice) in airtight containers at room temperature; refrigerate tofu in water (change daily), use within 3 days.
- **Safety**: Ensure all foods meet SIGHI score 0–1, oxalate <10 mg/100 g, and low-antinutrient criteria; discard if stored >24 hours post-preparation ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).

## Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Tracking**:
  - Log meals in **Cronometer** post-consumption (12:30 PM, 8:00 PM) to verify nutrient targets (~55.6 g protein, ~209.5–419.5 mg flavonoids/meal) ([Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md)).
  - Monitor symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, neuropathy, bloating, histamine, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition/sleep) in **MySymptoms** post-meal (1:30 PM, 9:00 PM) and daily (6:30 AM, 9:30 PM) ([Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md)).
- **Adjustments**:
  - If nutrients fall short (e.g., protein <111 g/day), increase tofu to 150 g/meal or sardines to 150 g/meal; if symptoms worsen (e.g., bloating >2 post-kale), reduce kale to 15 g/meal or substitute cauliflower per **Artifact_25_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanB.md** ([message](#message-4b05b1d7-1e02-4c50-a73a-d8d65a0a0c6e)).
  - If nutrient gaps persist (e.g., vitamin D <1000 IU/day), consider 1000 IU D3 supplement per **Artifact_14_SupplementRecommendations_PlanA.md** ([message](#message-4327a6b3-0da6-4db9-95c3-b99b88abf635)).
- **Consultation**: Share Cronometer/MySymptoms data with a nutritionist by July 1, 2025, to evaluate menu efficacy and adjust for long-term use (e.g., lipid monitoring due to ~744 mg/day cholesterol from eggs) ([Artifact_20_LongTermPlanning_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_20_LongTermPlanning_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Plan B Focus**: This artifact provides a simplified menu for Plan B, requiring less variety and preparation than Plan A’s 18-food menu, ideal for MS patients seeking ease and cost savings ([Artifact_05_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_05_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: All foods and preparation methods meet **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** standards, minimizing MS symptom triggers ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Budget**: Menu aligns with Plan B’s budget (~$99.63–$112.76 without optionals), using fewer ingredients than Plan A (~$141.13–$149.88) ([Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Menu supports the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals with high flavonoid and omega-3 content ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
- **Usability**: Simplified menu and preparation make Plan B accessible for MS patients with energy or cognitive constraints.
- **ZIP Request**: Your prior request for a ZIP file for Windows ([message](#message-4327a6b3-0da6-4db9-95c3-b99b88abf635]) included **Artifact_23** as a fully output artifact. This output confirms the content. Confirm if an updated ZIP or alternative delivery (e.g., cloud link) is needed.
