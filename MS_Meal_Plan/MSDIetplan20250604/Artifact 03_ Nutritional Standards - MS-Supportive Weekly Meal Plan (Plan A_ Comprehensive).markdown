# Artifact 03: Nutritional Standards - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 03: Nutritional Standards - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)**, defining the nutritional standards for **Plan A**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan A is a comprehensive dietary approach with 18 foods, delivering ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids to support **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document establishes the nutrient targets and dietary principles guiding Plan A’s design, ensuring compatibility with MS symptom management.

## Nutritional Standards

Plan A’s nutritional standards are based on MS research and user requirements, targeting optimal mitochondrial function, inflammation reduction, and cognitive health. The following standards guide the meal plan’s design, ensuring two meals/day (12:00 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 fasting schedule meet user needs.

### Macronutrients

- **Protein**: ~115 g/day (~1.6 g/kg body weight, range 1.2–2.0 g/kg, ~86–144 g/day)
  - **Purpose**: Supports muscle maintenance, mTOR activation, and mitochondrial repair, critical for MS-related fatigue and mobility ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
  - **Sources**: Eggs (~6 g/egg), tinned fish (~25 g/100 g), tofu (~10 g/100 g), avocado (~2 g/100 g, replacing turkey post-feedback).
  - **Target per Meal**: ~57.5 g/meal, achieved via combinations (e.g., 3 eggs + 100 g fish + 100 g tofu).
- **Leucine**: ~9.6–12.2 g/day (~2.5–3 g/meal)
  - **Purpose**: Activates mTOR signaling for protein synthesis and mitochondrial biogenesis, essential for MS ([Nutrients, 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/6/1719)).
  - **Sources**: Eggs (~0.5–0.6 g/egg), tinned fish (~1.8–2.0 g/100 g), tofu (~0.7 g/100 g).
  - **Target per Meal**: ~4.8–6.1 g/meal, ensuring anabolic threshold (~2.5 g leucine/meal).
- **Carbohydrates**: ~100–150 g/day (variable, prioritized from low-glycemic sources)
  - **Purpose**: Provides energy while minimizing blood sugar spikes, supporting MS-related energy needs.
  - **Sources**: Zucchini (~3 g/100 g), strawberries (~8 g/100 g), quinoa (~21 g/100 g).

  - **Target per Meal**: ~900–1020 mg/meal.
- **Potassium**: ~4376–6500 mg/day
  - **Purpose**: Regulates nerve function and muscle contractions, reducing spasticity in MS.
  - **Sources**: Avocado (~485 mg/100 g), zucchini (~261 mg/100 g), strawberries (~153 mg/100 g).
  - **Target per Meal**: ~2188–3250 mg/meal.

  - **Purpose**: Reduce inflammation and support neuronal integrity, beneficial for MS ([J Am Coll Cardiol, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5475232/)).
  - **Sources**: Tinned fish (~1–2 g/100 g), flaxseed oil (~2 g/tbsp, optional).
  - **Target per Meal**: ~0.75–1.5 g/meal.

### Dietary Preferences

- **Low-Histamine**: Foods with SIGHI scores 0–1 to minimize histamine reactions, common in MS.
  - **Examples**: Fresh eggs, tinned fish (stored <24 hours), zucchini, kale ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
  - **Preparation**: Consume within 24 hours, cook to 165°F, refrigerate at 35–40°F.
- **Low-Oxalate**: Foods with <10 mg/100 g to reduce kidney and neurological stress.
  - **Examples**: Zucchini (~2 mg/100 g), strawberries (~2 mg/100 g), quinoa (~0 mg/100 g).
- **Low-Antinutrient**: Minimize phytates, lectins, and oxalates through preparation (e.g., boiling, steaming).
  - **Examples**: Soak quinoa, steam kale to reduce phytates ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).

## Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Tracking**: Use **Cronometer** to monitor protein, leucine, flavonoids, calcium, potassium, and other nutrients, ensuring targets are met ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Symptom Monitoring**: Use **MySymptoms** to track fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, and histamine reactions (1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) ([Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_18_SymptomMonitoring_PlanA.md)).
- **Adjustments**: Substitutions (e.g., avocado for tofu if digestion issues) maintain nutrient targets ([Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md)). Consult a nutritionist for lipid monitoring due to egg intake (~744 mg/day cholesterol).

## Notes
- **Plan A Focus**: These standards prioritize nutrient diversity and complex preparation, differing from Plan B’s simplicity ([Artifact_22_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_22_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md)).
- **Safety**: All foods meet low-histamine, low-oxalate, and low-antinutrient criteria, with preparation guidelines to minimize risks ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Budget**: Nutrient targets are achieved within ~$141.13–$149.88, with cost optimization strategies ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Standards align with the MIND diet variant for cognitive health ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
