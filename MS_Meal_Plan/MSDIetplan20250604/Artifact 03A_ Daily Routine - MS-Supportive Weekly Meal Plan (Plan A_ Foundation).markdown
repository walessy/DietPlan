# Artifact 03A: Daily Routine - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 03A: Daily Routine (Plan A: Foundation)**, outlining the daily routine and meal schedule for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan A, the foundation plan, delivers ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal chicken). This routine supports MS symptom management (fatigue, spasticity, cognition) through structured meal timing and circadian health strategies. **Plan B** has a similar routine with adjusted nutrients (see **Artifact_03B_DailyRoutine_PlanB.md**).

## Daily Routine

The daily routine is designed to align with **circadian rhythms**, supporting melatonin production, mTOR activation, and MS symptom management through a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, two meals per day, and sleep optimization. The routine integrates dietary, light exposure, and activity strategies to enhance energy, cognition, and mobility.

### Meal Schedule
- **12:00 PM (Lunch)**:
  - **Timing**: Midday meal aligns with peak metabolic activity, supporting circadian-regulated digestion and nutrient absorption ([Chronobiol Int, 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7511788/)).
  - **Composition**: ~57.5 g protein (~4 g eggs, ~25 g fish/turkey/chicken/tofu/liver, ~3.6 g milk, ~1 g oat milk, ~2 g nutritional yeast, ~4 g lentils, ~2 g seeds), ~4.8–6.1 g leucine, ~124.57–240.39 mg flavonoids, ~19.5 g fiber, ~2453 mg potassium, ~751–821 mg calcium, ~1300–1850 IU vitamin D, ~1129.25 µg RAE vitamin A (monitor toxicity).
  - **Purpose**: Provides leucine (~4.8–6.1 g) for mTOR activation and brain-muscle connection, flavonoids for neuroprotection, and cofactors for mitochondrial energy production ([Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02A_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md)).
  - **Examples**: Tinned fish, eggs, zucchini, cucumber, strawberries, green tea (Wed–Tue); tofu, avocado, blueberries (Wed, Thu, Sun, Tue) ([Artifact_15A_SimplifiedMenu_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_15A_SimplifiedMenu_PlanA.md)).
- **7:30–8:00 PM (Dinner)**:
  - **Timing**: Evening meal within the 16:8 eating window (12:00 PM–8:00 PM) avoids late-night digestion, supporting melatonin production and circadian alignment ([J Pineal Res, 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6712900/)).
  - **Composition**: Similar to lunch (~57.5 g protein, ~4.8–6.1 g leucine, ~124.57–240.39 mg flavonoids, ~19.5 g fiber, ~2453 mg potassium, ~751–821 mg calcium, ~1300–1850 IU vitamin D, ~1129.25 µg RAE vitamin A).
  - **Purpose**: Sustains mTOR activity, delivers flavonoids for dementia prevention, and supports evening relaxation with choline (~250 mg/meal from eggs) for acetylcholine synthesis.
  - **Examples**: Chicken, eggs, bok choy, strawberries, green tea (Thu, Sat, Sun, Tue); liver, lettuce, parsley (Wed); turkey, pear (Thu) ([Artifact_15A_SimplifiedMenu_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_15A_SimplifiedMenu_PlanA.md)).
- **Fasting Period (8:00 PM–12:00 PM)**:
  - **Duration**: 16 hours fasting promotes autophagy, aligns with circadian cycles, and reduces mTOR activity overnight to balance daytime activation ([Artifact_12A_mTORAutophagy_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_12A_mTORAutophagy_PlanA.md)).
  - **Beverages**: Water, herbal tea (non-caffeinated) allowed to maintain hydration without disrupting fasting or histamine levels.

### Light Exposure and Sleep Schedule
- **Morning (10:00 AM–2:00 PM)**:
  - **Daylight Exposure**: 30–60 minutes of natural light exposure to suppress melatonin, enhance circadian alignment, and boost vitamin D (~500–1000 IU) ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
  - **Activity**: Light physical activity (e.g., walking, stretching) to support mobility and mTOR-driven muscle function ([Artifact_13A_ExerciseRoutine_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_13A_ExerciseRoutine_PlanA.md)).
- **Evening (6:00 PM–Bedtime)**:
  - **Light Management**: Use red light bulbs (2700K, ~$5–$10/bulb, ASDA) to promote melatonin production; avoid energy-efficient bulbs (CFLs, LEDs) to prevent melatonin suppression and health risks ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
  - **Blue-Light Blocking**: Wear blue-light-blocking glasses (~$10–$20) if screen exposure is unavoidable after 6:00 PM.
- **Sleep (10:00 PM–6:00 AM)**:
  - **Duration**: Aim for 7–9 hours in a dark bedroom (blackout curtains, ~$15–$30) to maximize melatonin and sleep quality, reducing MS fatigue and supporting cognition ([Artifact_09A_SleepRecovery_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09A_SleepRecovery_PlanA.md)).
  - **Preparation**: Avoid caffeine post-2:00 PM; consume eggs (choline, ~500 mg/day) to support sleep regulation.

### Daily Activities
- **Morning (8:00 AM–12:00 PM)**:
  - Hydration, light stretching, and daylight exposure to prepare for lunch and align circadian rhythms.
- **Afternoon (12:00 PM–6:00 PM)**:
  - Lunch at 12:00 PM, followed by moderate activity (e.g., walking, MS-friendly exercises) to enhance mTOR/leucine-driven brain-muscle connection ([Artifact_13A_ExerciseRoutine_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_13A_ExerciseRoutine_PlanA.md)).
- **Evening (6:00 PM–10:00 PM)**:
  - Dinner at 7:30–8:00 PM, relaxation (e.g., reading, meditation) under red light to support melatonin production and prepare for sleep.

## Notes
- **Circadian Alignment**: The 12:00 PM–8:00 PM eating window, daylight exposure, and red light use optimize melatonin production and circadian rhythms, reducing MS fatigue and enhancing cognition ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan B**: Plan B follows a similar 16:8 schedule with adjusted recipes (10 foods, ~104 g/day protein, ~449–899 mg/day flavonoids), maintaining circadian alignment but simpler preparation ([Artifact_03B_DailyRoutine_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_03B_DailyRoutine_PlanB.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track meal timing, sleep quality, fatigue, cognition, and circadian metrics (1–10 scale, aim <2 for fatigue, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms**; monitor nutrient intake via **Cronometer** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Customization**: Adjust meal times by ±30 minutes if needed, maintaining the 16:8 window; swap high-histamine foods (e.g., liver, lentils) if reactions occur ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Ensure food is consumed within 24 hours of cooking to minimize histamine; monitor vitamin A toxicity from liver (aim <2 for symptoms) ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
