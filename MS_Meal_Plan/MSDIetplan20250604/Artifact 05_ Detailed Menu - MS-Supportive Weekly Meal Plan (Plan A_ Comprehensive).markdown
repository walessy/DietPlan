# Artifact 05: Detailed Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 05: Detailed Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)**, providing a day-by-day menu for **Plan A**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan A is a comprehensive dietary approach with 18 foods, delivering ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids to support **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document details the menu for 14 meals (7 lunches, 7 dinners) across 7 days, including ingredients, nutrient breakdown, and preparation instructions. For an overview of Plan A and Plan B development, see **Artifact_01_IntroductionAndDevelopment.md**; for the project index, see **Artifact_02_TableOfContents.md**; for nutritional standards, see **Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md**; for the daily routine, see **Artifact_04_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md**.

## Menu Overview
- **Schedule**: Two meals/day (lunch at 12:00 PM, dinner at 7:30–8:00 PM) within a 16:8 fasting schedule (eating window: 12:00 PM–8:00 PM), aligning with circadian rhythms ([Artifact_04_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_04_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md)).
- **Nutrient Targets per Meal**: ~57.5 g protein, ~4.8–6.1 g leucine, ~129.57–245.39 mg flavonoids, ~900–1020 mg calcium, ~2188–3250 mg potassium, ~25–35 g fats, ~50–75 g carbohydrates ([Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md)).
- **Foods**: 18 low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), low-antinutrient foods, including eggs, tinned fish, tofu, avocado, zucchini, kale, strawberries, quinoa, fortified oat milk, green tea, olive oil, and others ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Preparation**: Boiling, steaming, or sautéing to minimize histamine and antinutrients; consume within 24 hours, store at 35–40°F ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
- **Variations**: Substitutions (e.g., quinoa for rice, kale for spinach) maintain nutrient targets ([Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md)).

## Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Tracking**: Use **Cronometer** to verify nutrient intake (protein, leucine, flavonoids, calcium, potassium) aligns with **Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md** and **MySymptoms** to monitor symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Adjustments**: Modify ingredients if symptoms arise (e.g., replace broccoli with zucchini if bloating exceeds 2) or adjust portions to maintain nutrient targets ([Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md)). Consult a nutritionist for lipid monitoring due to egg intake (~744 mg/day cholesterol).
- **Customization**: Substitutions (e.g., blueberries for strawberries, rice for quinoa) are detailed in **Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md** to accommodate preferences or availability while meeting standards.

## Notes
- **Plan A Focus**: This menu emphasizes nutrient diversity and complex preparation, differing from Plan B’s simpler approach ([Artifact_23_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_23_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md)).
- **Safety**: All foods meet low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), and low-antinutrient criteria, with preparation guidelines to minimize risks ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Budget**: Menu aligns with Plan A’s budget (~$141.13–$149.88), with cost-effective sourcing ([Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md), [Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Menu supports the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals through flavonoid-rich foods like strawberries and blueberries ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
- **Preparation**: Meals are designed for daily preparation to ensure freshness; batch prep is possible if consumed within 24 hours ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
