# Artifact 07: Food Compatibility - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 07: Food Compatibility - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)**, outlining food compatibility guidelines for **Plan A**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan A is a comprehensive dietary approach with 18 foods, delivering ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids to support **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document ensures all foods meet strict compatibility criteria for MS symptom management, detailing histamine, oxalate, and antinutrient profiles, preparation methods, and storage guidelines. For an overview of Plan A and Plan B development, see **Artifact_01_IntroductionAndDevelopment.md**; for the project index, see **Artifact_02_TableOfContents.md**; for nutritional standards, see **Artifact_03_NutritionalStandards_PlanA.md**; for the menu, see **Artifact_05_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md**; for the shopping list, see **Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**.

## Compatibility Overview

- **Purpose**: Ensures foods in Plan A’s 7-day menu (14 meals) are compatible with MS needs, minimizing histamine reactions, oxalate accumulation, and antinutrient interference to reduce symptoms like fatigue, spasticity, neuropathy, and cognitive impairment.
- **Criteria**:
  - **Low-Histamine**: SIGHI scores 0–1 to prevent histamine intolerance reactions, common in MS ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
  - **Low-Oxalate**: <10 mg/100 g to reduce kidney and neurological stress ([The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
  - **Low-Antinutrient**: Minimized phytates, lectins, and oxalates through preparation to enhance nutrient absorption ([Nutrients, 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/6/1719)).
- **Foods**: 18 ingredients (eggs, tinned sardines, tinned mackerel, tofu, avocado, zucchini, broccoli, kale, strawberries, blueberries, quinoa, fortified oat milk, green tea, olive oil, rice, spinach, cauliflower, flaxseed oil) from **Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md**, selected for compatibility ([Artifact_05_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_05_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md)).
- **Preparation**: Boiling, steaming, or sautéing to reduce histamine and antinutrients; consume within 24 hours, store at 35–40°F ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track symptoms (fatigue, bloating, cognition, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) with **MySymptoms** to verify compatibility ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).

## Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Tracking**: Use **MySymptoms** to monitor symptoms (fatigue, bloating, cognition, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) post-meal to confirm food compatibility; verify nutrient intake with **Cronometer** ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Adjustments**: If symptoms arise (e.g., bloating >2), replace suspect foods (e.g., kale with spinach) per **Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md**; adjust preparation (e.g., shorter steaming) to reduce histamine ([Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md)).
- **Consultation**: Consult a nutritionist for persistent symptoms or to assess lipid profiles due to egg and oil intake; consider supplements if nutrient gaps occur ([Artifact_14_SupplementRecommendations_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_14_SupplementRecommendations_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Plan A Focus**: These guidelines support Plan A’s comprehensive menu, requiring stricter compatibility than Plan B’s simpler food list ([Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_24_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **Safety**: All foods are selected and prepared to minimize histamine, oxalate, and antinutrient risks, critical for MS symptom management ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Budget**: Compatibility aligns with Plan A’s budget (~$141.13–$149.88), with cost-effective sourcing and preparation ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Guidelines support the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals through compatible, flavonoid-rich foods ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
- **Preparation**: Daily preparation or consumption within 24 hours ensures safety; batch prep is feasible if refrigerated ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
