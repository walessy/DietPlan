# Artifact 13: Simplified Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 13: Simplified Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Comprehensive)**, providing a concise version of **Plan A**, a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. Plan A is a comprehensive dietary approach with 18 foods, delivering ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids to support **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **dementia prevention**, and **circadian alignment**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). This document simplifies Plan A’s 14-meal menu (7 lunches, 7 dinners) to reduce preparation complexity while maintaining key nutrients, ideal for users seeking ease without sacrificing efficacy.

## Simplified Menu Overview

- **Purpose**: Streamlines Plan A’s menu to minimize ingredients and preparation steps while meeting nutrient targets (~57.5 g protein, ~4.8–6.1 g leucine, ~129.57–245.39 mg flavonoids per meal; ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids) for MS symptom management (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating).
- **Foods**: Reduced to 9 core ingredients (eggs, tinned sardines, tofu, avocado, zucchini, kale, strawberries, fortified oat milk, green tea) from Plan A’s 18, prioritizing nutrient density and simplicity ([Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06_ShoppingList_PlanA.md)).
- **Schedule**: Two meals/day (lunch at 12:00 PM, dinner at 7:30–8:00 PM) within a 16:8 fasting schedule, aligning with circadian rhythms ([Artifact_04_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_04_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md)).
- **Preparation**: Focus on steaming and boiling to reduce histamine and antinutrients; consume within 24 hours, store at 35–40°F ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track nutrients with **Cronometer** and symptoms (1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) with **MySymptoms** to ensure efficacy ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).

## Simplified Daily Menu

The simplified menu uses a standardized meal structure for all 14 meals, reducing variety for ease while maintaining nutrient targets. Each meal includes:

- **Ingredients**: 3 eggs (hard-boiled), 100 g tinned sardines (drained), 100 g tofu (steamed), 100 g avocado (sliced), 100 g zucchini (steamed), 30 g kale (steamed), 100 g strawberries, 400 g fortified oat milk, 200 ml green tea.
- **Nutrients (Approximate)**: ~58 g protein, ~5.0 g leucine, ~140 mg flavonoids, ~950 mg calcium, ~2300 mg potassium, ~30 g fats, ~60 g carbohydrates, ~200 µg RAE vitamin A, ~500 IU vitamin D, ~2 µg vitamin B12, ~4 mg iron, ~1 g omega-3s.
- **Preparation**: Boil eggs (10–12 min), steam tofu, zucchini, and kale (8–10 min for tofu/zucchini, 5–7 min for kale), drain sardines, slice avocado and strawberries, shake oat milk, brew green tea (80–85°C, 2–3 min). Serve fresh; refrigerate leftovers at 35–40°F, consume within 24 hours ([Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11_MealPrepGuidelines_PlanA.md)).

- **Protein**: ~116 g/day (2 x 58 g).
- **Leucine**: ~10.0 g/day (2 x 5.0 g).
- **Flavonoids**: ~280 mg/day (2 x 140 mg).
- **Calcium**: ~1900 mg/day (2 x 950 mg).
- **Potassium**: ~4600 mg/day (2 x 2300 mg).
- **Fats**: ~60 g/day (2 x 30 g).

- **Iron**: ~8 mg/day (2 x 4 mg).
- **Omega-3s**: ~2 g/day (2 x 1 g).

## Monitoring and Adjustments
- **Tracking**: Use **Cronometer** to verify nutrient intake meets targets (~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids); log symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) with **MySymptoms** to assess menu efficacy ([Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_09_TrackingTools_PlanA.md), [Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_12_NutrientTracking_PlanA.md)).
- **Adjustments**: If nutrients are low (e.g., protein <115 g/day), increase tofu to 150 g/meal or add 50 g quinoa; if symptoms arise (e.g., bloating >2), reduce kale to 15 g/meal or substitute spinach per **Artifact_08_ShoppingAndCustomization_PlanA.md**. Consult a nutritionist for persistent issues or lipid monitoring (~744 mg/day cholesterol) ([Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_19_DietaryAdjustments_PlanA.md)).
- **Consultation**: Share **Cronometer** and **MySymptoms** data with a nutritionist by July 1, 2025, to evaluate nutrient adequacy and symptom trends; consider supplements if gaps persist (e.g., vitamin D <1000 IU/day) ([Artifact_14_SupplementRecommendations_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_14_SupplementRecommendations_PlanA.md)).

## Notes
- **Plan A Focus**: This simplified menu reduces Plan A’s complexity (18 to 9 foods, standardized meals) while maintaining nutrient targets, offering a middle ground between Plan A’s variety and Plan B’s simplicity ([Artifact_23_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_23_DetailedMenu_PlanB.md)).
- **Safety**: All foods meet low-histamine (SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (<10 mg/100 g), and low-antinutrient criteria, minimizing MS symptom triggers ([Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Budget**: Simplified menu aligns with Plan A’s budget (~$141.13–$149.88), using fewer ingredients for cost efficiency ([Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17_CostOptimization_PlanA.md)).
- **MIND Variant**: Menu supports the MIND diet variant’s cognitive goals with flavonoid-rich strawberries and kale ([Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_28_MIND_PlanA.md)).
- **Usability**: Standardized meals and reduced ingredients enhance ease of preparation, ideal for users with time or energy constraints due to MS.
