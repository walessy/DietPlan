# Artifact 04B: Detailed Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 04B: Detailed Menu (Plan B: Derivative)**, providing a day-by-day menu for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan B, a simplified derivative of Plan A, delivers ~111 g/day protein, ~10.4–12.0 g/day leucine, and ~419–839 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no meat). Shopping was ordered on June 3, 2025, for delivery on June 4, 2025 (~$99.63–$112.73 without aloe vera/carrots, ~$103.13–$116.23 with aloe vera/carrots). The menu supports MS symptom management through two meals/day (12:00 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 fasting schedule. For Plan A, see **Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md**; for standards, see **Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md**; for shopping, see **Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md**; for customizations, see **Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md**; for tracking, see **Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md**.

## Detailed Menu

The menu is structured for two meals daily (12:00 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 fasting schedule, aligning with circadian rhythms ([Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md)). Each meal provides ~55.5 g protein, ~5.2–6.0 g leucine, ~209.5–419.5 mg flavonoids, with kale replacing parsley, fortified oat milk replacing bone broth, tinned fish replacing beef, 2 whole eggs + 3 egg whites/meal, tinned fish (150 g/12 meals), lactose-free milk (150 g/meal), kiwi (200 g/meal), fresh ginger root (2 g/meal), and optional aloe vera juice (30 g/meal) for gut health. Preparation minimizes histamine (consume within 24 hours).

## Notes
- **Circadian Alignment**: Meals at 12:00 PM and 7:30–8:00 PM align with circadian rhythms, supporting melatonin and mTOR ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
- **Nutrient Consistency**: Each meal meets ~55.5 g protein, ~5.2–6.0 g leucine, ~209.5–419.5 mg flavonoids, ensuring mTOR activation, dementia prevention, and mitochondrial support ([Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan A**: Plan A uses 18 foods (~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~259.14–490.78 mg/day flavonoids) with complex prep. Plan B’s 9 foods (~$99.63–$116.23) reduce cost, complexity, and histamine risk ([Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md)).
- **Health Monitoring**: Monitor cholesterol/lipid panels (HDL ≥60 mg/dL, LDL <100 mg/dL, triglycerides <150 mg/dL) annually due to whole eggs (4/day, ~744 mg cholesterol/day), consult a nutritionist/doctor for MS and age-related risks (>40), track symptoms (digestion, fatigue, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms**/**Cronometer** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Customization**: Swap strawberries for oranges (~$0.25/100 g) if bloating; add carrots (~$0.20/100 g) for vitamin A (~200 µg RAE/meal, ~400 µg to ~800 µg RAE/day); ensure substitutions maintain flavonoids (~419–839 mg/day) ([Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10B_CustomizableTemplate_PlanB.md)).
- **Safety**: Cook to 165°F; consume within 24 hours to minimize histamine; refrigerate at 35–40°F; steam kale ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
