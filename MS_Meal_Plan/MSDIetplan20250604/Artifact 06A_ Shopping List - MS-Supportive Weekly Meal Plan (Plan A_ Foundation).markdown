# Artifact 06A: Shopping List - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 06A: Shopping List (Plan A: Foundation)**, detailing the ingredients required for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan A, the foundation plan, delivers ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal chicken). The shopping list supports the comprehensive menu (18 foods, 33 items, ~$128.93–$137.68) for two meals/day (12:00 PM, 7:30–8:00 PM) within a 16:8 fasting schedule. Shopping is referenced for ASDA on **Tuesday, June 3, 2025**, for delivery on **Wednesday, June 4, 2025**. **Plan B** has a separate shopping list (see **Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md**).

## Notes
- **Storage (June 4 Delivery to June 25–July 1)**:
  - **Protein Sources**: Refrigerate eggs, fish, liver, turkey, tofu at 35–40°F; freeze chicken (~1.45 kg), liver if not used by June 6, in freezer bags at 0°F. Consume within 24 hours of cooking to minimize histamine ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
  - **Vegetables/Fruits**: Refrigerate zucchini, cucumber, bok choy, lettuce, green beans, broccoli, avocado, berries, pear at 35–40°F; store squash, lentils at 50–70°F. Peel zucchini/cucumber to reduce antinutrients ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
  - **Staples**: Freeze refrigerated broth (~1900 ml) in freezer bags; refrigerate milk, parsley at 35–40°F; store oil, nutritional yeast, seeds, spices, vinegar, tea at 50–70°F.
- **Preparation**:
  - Complex prep: Soak lentils/tofu/seeds 4–8 hours, boil eggs/fish/chicken, sauté liver/turkey, steam/roast vegetables. Consume within 24 hours ([Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md)).
  - Minimize chicken (4 dinners) to avoid constipation; prioritize eggs, fish for leucine and omega-3s.
- **Sourcing**: All items available at ASDA, with alternatives (e.g., Tesco, Sainsbury’s). Verify availability for June 3, 2025, order ([Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan B**: Plan B’s list includes 12 items (~$92.70–$103.80, ordered June 3, 2025), with simpler ingredients (e.g., eggs, beef, kiwi) and higher flavonoids, within ordered constraints ([Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_06B_ShoppingList_PlanB.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track purchases via receipts; monitor symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** to adjust sourcing if needed ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Customization**: Swap strawberries for oranges (~$2.50/1000 g) if bloating; reduce lentils/tofu if digestive issues ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).
