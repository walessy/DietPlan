# Artifact 04B: Detailed Menu - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan B: Derivative)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 04B: Detailed Menu (Plan B: Derivative)**, providing a day-by-day menu for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan B, a derivative of Plan A (see **Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md**), is simplified for cost, complexity, and histamine risk, adjusted for **increased mTOR activity** (~104 g/day protein, ~1.45 g/kg), **leucine** (~9–10.4 g/day), and **flavonoids** (~449–899 mg/day) to strengthen brain-muscle connection and reduce dementia risk, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, and addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no chicken). Shopping was ordered on June 3, 2025, for delivery on June 4, 2025 (~$92.70–$103.80). The menu supports MS symptom management (fatigue, spasticity, cognition) through two meals/day (12:00 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule.

## Detailed Menu

The menu is structured for two meals daily (12:00 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 fasting schedule, aligning with circadian rhythms to support melatonin production and metabolic health ([Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md)). Each meal provides ~52 g protein, ~4.5–5.2 g leucine, ~224.5–449.5 mg flavonoids, and other cofactors to meet Plan B’s nutritional standards ([Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md)). Preparation methods minimize histamine (e.g., consume within 24 hours).

## Notes
- **Circadian Alignment**: Meals at 12:00 PM and 7:30–8:00 PM align with circadian rhythms, supporting melatonin production and metabolic health, enhanced by red light exposure post-6:00 PM ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).
- **Nutrient Consistency**: Each meal meets ~52 g protein, ~4.5–5.2 g leucine, ~224.5–449.5 mg flavonoids, ensuring mTOR activation, dementia prevention, and mitochondrial support ([Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_02B_NutritionalStandards_PlanB.md)).
- **Comparison to Plan A**: Plan A’s menu uses 18 foods (~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids) with complex prep (e.g., soaking lentils/tofu). Plan B’s 10 foods and simpler prep (no soaking) reduce cost (~$92.70–$103.80 vs. ~$128.93–$137.68) and histamine risk while boosting flavonoids ([Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_04A_DetailedMenu_PlanA.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Track nutrient intake via **Cronometer**; monitor symptoms (fatigue, spasticity, cognition, bloating, histamine reactions, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)). Monitor vitamin A (~630 µg RAE/day, slightly below RNI ~700 µg) and thiamine (~1.2 mg/day) long-term.
- **Customization**: Swap strawberries for oranges (~10–20 mg flavonoids/100 g, ~$0.25/100 g) if bloating; replace kiwi with blackberries (~$0.75/75 g) if unavailable; ensure substitutions maintain flavonoids (~449–899 mg/day) ([Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_10A_CustomizableTemplate_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Cook to 165°F; consume within 24 hours to minimize histamine; refrigerate at 35–40°F; peel kiwi to reduce antinutrients ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
