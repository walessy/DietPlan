# Artifact 01A: Table of Contents - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 01A: Table of Contents (Plan A: Foundation)**, outlining the structure of a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. Plan A, the foundation plan, delivers ~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, and ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids, with **circadian alignment** to optimize **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuins**, **telomeres**, **mTOR activity**, and **sleep regulation**, while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, minimal chicken). This document lists all articles for Plan A, including nutritional standards, menu details, and supplementary strategies. Plan B is a separate derivative plan (see **Artifact_01B_ToC_PlanB.md**).

## Notes
- **Plan A Scope**: Comprehensive menu (18 foods) with detailed strategies for MS symptom management, suitable for users seeking variety and robust nutrient delivery.
- **Plan B Comparison**: Plan B simplifies to 10 foods (~$92.70–$103.80) with higher flavonoids (~449–899 mg/day) and reduced complexity (see **Artifact_01B_ToC_PlanB.md**).
- **Implementation**: Use Plan A for foundation guidance or Plan B for simplicity. Monitor via **MySymptoms**/**Cronometer** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Ensure low-histamine preparation (consume within 24 hours, refrigerate 35–40°F) ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
