# Artifact 18A: MIND Diet - MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan (Plan A: Foundation)

## Introduction

This is **Artifact 18A: MIND Diet (Plan A: Foundation)**, a comprehensive overview of the MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay) diet, including a summary of its principles, a typical weekly meal plan, and detailed daily breakdowns for all 7 days, tailored to complement a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg. The MIND diet promotes brain health and reduces dementia risk, aligning with **Plan A** (~115 g/day protein, ~9.6–12.2 g/day leucine, ~249.14–480.78 mg/day flavonoids) and **Plan B** (~104 g/day protein, ~9–10.4 g/day leucine, ~449–899 mg/day flavonoids), which focus on **mitochondrial health**, **mTOR activity**, **leucine**, **flavonoids**, and **circadian alignment** while maintaining **low-histamine**, **low-oxalate**, and **low-antinutrient** preferences, addressing user needs (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, no apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no chicken). This article adapts MIND principles for MS compatibility, prioritizing low-histamine, low-oxalate foods. For Plan A menu, see **Artifact_15A_SimplifiedMenu_PlanA.md**; for Plan B, see **Artifact_15B_SimplifiedMenu_PlanB.md**; for nutritional standards, see **Artifact_02A/B_NutritionalStandards_PlanA/B.md**; for flavonoids, see **Artifact_16A/B_FlavonoidsDementia_PlanA/B.md**; for tracking, see **Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md**.

## MIND Diet Summary

The MIND diet, developed by Rush University, combines Mediterranean and DASH diets to reduce Alzheimer’s risk (~53% with strict adherence, ~35% with moderate) and slow cognitive decline ([Alzheimer’s Dement, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4532650/)). It emphasizes 10 brain-healthy food groups and limits 5 unhealthy ones, promoting antioxidants (e.g., flavonoids), omega-3s, and healthy fats.

### Brain-Healthy Foods (10 Groups)
- **Leafy Greens**: 6+ servings/week (~1 cup raw or ½ cup cooked, e.g., romaine lettuce, kale).
- **Other Vegetables**: 1+ serving/day (~½ cup cooked or 1 cup raw, e.g., broccoli, zucchini).
- **Berries**: 2+ servings/week (~½ cup, e.g., strawberries, blueberries).
- **Nuts**: 5+ servings/week (~1 oz or ¼ cup, e.g., almonds, walnuts).
- **Whole Grains**: 3+ servings/day (~½ cup cooked or 1 slice bread, e.g., oats, quinoa).
- **Fish**: 1+ serving/week (~3–4 oz, e.g., sardines, mackerel).
- **Poultry**: 2+ servings/week (~3–4 oz, e.g., turkey).
- **Beans**: 3–4 servings/week (~½ cup cooked, e.g., chickpeas).
- **Olive Oil**: Primary cooking fat (~1–2 tbsp/day).
- **Wine**: 1 glass/day (optional, ~5 oz, red preferred; excluded for MS low-histamine needs).

### Foods to Limit (5 Groups)
- **Red Meat**: <4 servings/week (~3–4 oz).
- **Butter/Margarine**: <1 tbsp/day.
- **Cheese**: <1 serving/week (~1 oz).
- **Pastries/Sweets**: <5 servings/week.
- **Fried/Fast Food**: <1 serving/week.

### Benefits
- Reduces Alzheimer’s risk via flavonoids (berries, greens), omega-3s (fish), and healthy fats (olive oil, nuts).
- Supports MS by reducing inflammation and promoting neuroprotection, complementing Plan A/B’s flavonoid and omega-3 focus ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

## MS Compatibility
- **Low-Histamine**: Uses fresh fish, eggs, turkey (SIGHI score 0–1), avoiding high-histamine cheese, red meat, and wine. Chickpeas are soaked to reduce histamine/antinutrients ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Low-Oxalate**: Prioritizes broccoli, romaine lettuce, zucchini (<10 mg/100 g oxalate) over high-oxalate greens; strawberries and kiwi are low-oxalate ([The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **User Preferences**: Excludes apples/cocoa due to neuropathy; omits chicken, using eggs/turkey; emphasizes tinned fish (omega-3s, gut health) and eggs (choline, alertness/sleep).
- **Circadian Alignment**: Adopts Plan A/B’s 16:8 fasting (12:00 PM–8:00 PM eating window) to optimize melatonin and metabolic health ([Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_17A_MelatoninCircadian_PlanA.md)).

## Weekly Nutrient Summary
- **Protein**: ~455 g/week (~65 g/day, below Plan A’s ~115 g, Plan B’s ~104 g; low for MS mTOR needs).
- **Leucine**: ~28–35 g/week (~4–5 g/day, below Plan A’s ~9.6–12.2 g, Plan B’s ~9–10.4 g).
- **Fiber**: ~70 g/week (~10 g/day, below RNI ~30 g, Plan A/B’s ~37–39 g; needs boost for MS constipation).
- **Flavonoids**: ~350–560 mg/week (~50–80 mg/day, below Plan A’s ~249.14–480.78 mg, Plan B’s ~449–899 mg).
- **Potassium**: ~9684 mg/week (~1382 mg/day, below RNI ~3500 mg, Plan A’s ~4906 mg, Plan B’s ~4500 mg).
- **Calcium**: ~3360 mg/week (~480 mg/day, below RNI 740 mg, Plan A’s ~1502.71–1642.71 mg, Plan B’s ~1400–1500 mg).
- **Vitamin D**: ~8400 IU/week (~1200 IU/day dietary, below MS needs ~2000–4000 IU without sun exposure).
- **Vitamin B12**: ~16.03 µg/week (~2.29 µg/day, exceeds RNI ~1.5 µg, below Plan A’s ~6.24 µg, Plan B’s ~5.5 µg).
- **Iron**: ~17.5 mg/week (~2.5 mg/day, below RNI ~8.7 mg, Plan A’s ~12.66 mg, Plan B’s ~10.5 mg).
- **Omega-3s**: ~3.44–6.86 g/week (~0.49–0.98 g/day, meets ~0.5–2 g/day target, below Plan A/B’s ~1.72–3.43 g/day).
- **Choline**: ~2250 mg/week (~321 mg/day, below AI ~550 mg/day, Plan A’s ~500 mg, Plan B’s ~625 mg).

## Notes
- **MS Compatibility**: Prioritizes low-histamine (fresh fish, eggs, turkey; SIGHI score 0–1), low-oxalate (broccoli, lettuce, zucchini, kiwi, strawberries) foods, omitting chicken, apples, cocoa, and wine. Chickpeas are soaked to reduce histamine/antinutrients.
- **Comparison to Plan A/B**:
  - **Similarities**: Berries, fish, greens, and nuts align with Plan A/B’s flavonoid and omega-3 focus. 16:8 fasting matches circadian alignment ([Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_03A_DailyRoutine_PlanA.md)).
  - **Differences**: MIND’s lower protein (~65 g/day), leucine (~4–5 g/day), and flavonoids (~50–80 mg/day) are insufficient for MS mTOR and cognitive needs compared to Plan A (~115 g, ~9.6–12.2 g, ~249.14–480.78 mg) and Plan B (~104 g, ~9–10.4 g, ~449–899 mg). MIND includes grains/beans, absent in Plan B.
- **Integration Tips**:
  - Add quinoa (~½ cup/day, ~$0.50/100 g) to Plan B for MIND’s grain benefits, if histamine-tolerant.
  - Increase eggs (6 to 7/meal, ~$0.11/egg) or fish (100 g to 150 g, ~$1.25/125 g can) in MIND to approach Plan A/B’s protein/leucine targets.
  - Boost flavonoids with parsley (~30 g/meal, ~$0.15, ~30–60 mg) or green tea (~200 ml, ~$0.05, ~200–400 mg EGCG) to align with Plan B ([Artifact_16B_FlavonoidsDementia_PlanB.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_16B_FlavonoidsDementia_PlanB.md)).
  - Monitor symptoms (cognition, fatigue, bloating, 1–10 scale, aim <2, >7 for cognition) via **MySymptoms** ([Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_11A_TrackingTools_PlanA.md)).
- **Safety**: Cook to 165°F; consume within 24 hours, refrigerate 35–40°F; soak chickpeas; limit high-oxalate greens if symptoms >2 ([Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact_07A_FoodCompatibility_PlanA.md)).
- **Cost Estimate**: ~$70–$90/week (ASDA, June 2025), lower than Plan A (~$128.93–$137.68) and Plan B (~$92.70–$103.80).
