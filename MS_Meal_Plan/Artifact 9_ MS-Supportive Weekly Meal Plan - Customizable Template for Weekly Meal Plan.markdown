# Artifact 9: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Customizable Template for Weekly Meal Plan

## Customizable Template for Weekly Meal Plan

This is **Artifact 9: Customizable Template for Weekly Meal Plan**, providing a flexible framework to adapt the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025) for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, with weaker digestive motility impacting gut function. The plan adheres to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated by reducing intake and adding tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), neuropathy from apples/cocoa (excluded), and the use of whole chickens (2 x 1.45 kg) to source bones for bone broth. The base menu, from **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md), delivers ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, with ~30–35 g fiber/day, ~9–10 cups/day raw vegetables, and ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day. This template allows customization of foods, schedules, and supplements while maintaining dietary constraints, with shopping ordered online at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 10, 2025**, and delivery on **Friday evening, June 13, 2025**. For routine, see **Artifact 2** (./Article2.md); for menu, see **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md); for AIP, see **Artifact 13** (./Article13.md).

### Template Overview

This template enables adjustments to the meal plan to accommodate symptom changes, preferences, or sourcing constraints while ensuring compliance with dietary restrictions. It includes sections for meal planning, shopping, preparation, and monitoring, supporting digestion and MS management ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).

### Customizable Meal Plan Template

#### Weekly Meal Plan (June 15–21, 2025)

**Nutritional Targets**:
- **Protein**: ~115 g/day (~57.5 g/meal), ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal.
- **Fiber**: ~30–35 g/day (~15–17.5 g/meal).
- **Vegetables**: ~9–10 cups/day raw (~4.5–5 cups/meal).
- **Potassium**: ~3,700–4,300 mg/day (~1850–2150 mg/meal).
- **Choline**: ~500–625 mg/day.
- **Constraints**: Low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free (<10 mg/100g), low-FODMAP, leaky gut/MS-supportive ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).

**Base Menu (from Artifact 15)**:
- **Protein**: Eggs (4/meal), tinned fish (100 g, 3 meals/week), chicken (100 g, 11 meals/week), liver (50 g, 1 meal/week).
- **Vegetables**: Zucchini (200 g/meal), lettuce (100 g/meal).
- **Fruits**: Avocado (30 g, 6 meals/week), blueberries (75 g, 3 meals/week), pear (50 g, 3 meals/week).
- **Staples**: Bone broth (200 ml/meal), olive oil (3 tbsp/meal), ginger (5 g/meal), coconut yogurt (1 tbsp, 2 meals/week).
- **Supplements**: Magnesium citrate (200–400 mg/day), R-ALA (600 mg/day), others ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).

**Customization Instructions**:
1. **Protein**: Replace tinned fish/chicken with compliant alternatives (e.g., fresh turkey, ~2.0–2.3 g leucine/100 g) if sourcing issues arise, ensuring ~57.5 g protein/meal ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md)).
2. **Vegetables**: Substitute zucchini/lettuce with low-FODMAP, low-oxalate greens (e.g., cucumber, ~2 g fiber/200 g), maintaining ~3 cups/meal ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
3. **Fruits**: Adjust avocado/blueberries/pear quantities (e.g., increase pear to 100 g for constipation), monitor oxalates/FODMAPs ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
4. **Staples**: Replace yogurt with AIP-compliant probiotic (e.g., coconut kefir) if bloating occurs ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
5. **Supplements**: Modify dosages (e.g., increase magnesium citrate to 400 mg for sleep) based on symptoms ([Article4.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact4.md)).
6. **Timing**: Adjust fasting window (e.g., 14:10, 10:00 AM–8:00 PM) if hunger disrupts sleep ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md)).

### Notes

- **Flexibility**: Template supports symptom-driven adjustments, maintaining dietary constraints ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
- **Digestive Support**: Bone broth, avocados, pear address weaker motility, with minimal chicken (~1100 g/week) to reduce constipation ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Whole Chickens**: Two 1.45 kg chickens provide meat (~1100 g) and bone broth (~2000 ml) ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **AIP Compliance**: Nightshade-free, includes liver, yogurt ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Accessibility**: Clear structure accommodates MS cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
