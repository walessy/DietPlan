# Artifact 14: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Simplified Weekly Menu (Plan B)

## Simplified Weekly Menu

This is **Artifact 14: Simplified Weekly Menu (Plan B)**, providing a concise overview of a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients** (e.g., lectins, phytates), with no strict dietary restrictions, delivering ~100 g protein/day (~50 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. It enhances **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuin** activation, and **telomere** maintenance through dietary cofactors (**thiamine**, **riboflavin**, **niacin**, **pantothenic acid**, **pyridoxine**, **biotin**, **cobalamin**, **phosphorus**, **magnesium**, **iron**, **copper**, **manganese**, **zinc**, **selenium**, **potassium**) and bioactive compounds (**EGCG** from green tea, **acetic acid** from vinegar, **alpha-lipoic acid** from broccoli), while reducing **mTOR activity** to mitigate MS-related inflammation, fatigue, spasticity, and neurodegeneration. The streamlined, low-cost menu incorporates **kiwi fruit** for its vitamin C, fiber, and flavonoids, and **lean ground beef** (480 g, ~68.6 g/meal, 7 meals/week) for its protein, zinc, and niacin, addresses user preferences (eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish for gut health, exclusion of apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, no chicken meat to avoid constipation), and minimizes preparation complexity. Shopping is ordered at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, for delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**, totaling ~$82.39–$92.39. For detailed menu, see **Artifact 3** (./Article3.md); for nutritional standards, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md); for mitochondrial strategies, see **Artifact 13** (./Article13.md).

### Notes
- **Mitochondrial Health**: The menu delivers cofactors (**thiamine** ~1.5 mg/day, **niacin** ~20 mg NE/day, **magnesium** ~350 mg/day, **vitamin D** ~2600–3600 IU/day) for **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, flavonoids (~250–350 mg/day from kiwi, green tea, parsley) for **mitophagy** and **sirtuin** activation, and **alpha-lipoic acid** (broccoli) and **acetic acid** (vinegar) to reduce **mTOR activity**, supporting MS energy, cognition, and neuroprotection ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **MS Symptom Management**: **Fiber** (~30 g/day) from potatoes, broccoli, and kiwi alleviates constipation; **vitamin D** reduces relapse risk; **flavonoids** and **omega-3s** (~1.72–3.43 g/day from fish) mitigate spasticity and cognitive decline; **choline** (~500 mg/day from eggs) supports alertness/sleep; **B12** (~5 µg/day from eggs, fish, beef, milk) and **iron** (~10 mg/day) reduce fatigue and neuropathy; lean beef minimizes constipation risk with high fiber ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Beef Preparation and Storage**: Use **480 g lean ground beef** (~68.6 g/meal, 7 dinners):
  - **June 20 (Delivery)**: Refrigerate at 35–40°F in original packaging or airtight container. Divide into ~240 g (Batch 1, June 25), ~120 g (Batch 2, June 29), ~120 g (Batch 3, July 1). Freeze two ~120 g portions in freezer bags (labeled “June 29”, “July 1”) at 0°F.
  - **June 25 (Day 1)**: Cook ~240 g (sauté in 1 tbsp olive oil, 165°F internal temperature, ~5–7 min), portion into 3.5 x ~68.6 g for June 25–28 dinners, refrigerate (35–40°F) in airtight containers, use by June 28.
  - **June 29 (Day 5)**: Thaw ~120 g in fridge (June 28 evening, 8–12 hours), cook, portion into 1.75 x ~68.6 g for June 29–30 dinners, refrigerate, use by June 30.
  - **July 1 (Day 7)**: Thaw ~120 g in fridge (June 30 evening, 8–12 hours), cook, use ~68.6 g for July 1 dinner, refrigerate remainder (~51.4 g) for July 2.
  - **Safety**: Cook to 165°F; consume/refrigerate within 2 hours; monitor histamine reactions and constipation (1–10 scale, aim <2) in **MySymptoms**; reduce beef to 50 g/meal if issues >2 ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Kiwi Benefits**: **Vitamin C** (~92.7 mg/100 g), **fiber** (~3 g/100 g), **flavonoids** (~10–20 mg/100 g), and **potassium** (~312 mg/100 g) support **mitophagy**, reduce inflammation, aid digestion, and promote nerve health at low cost (~$3.50/1000 g) ([USDA FoodData Central, 2018](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)).
- **Preparation**: Boil eggs, fish, potatoes; sauté beef; steam broccoli; consume kiwi raw; refrigerate at 35–40°F, use within 24 hours to minimize histamine; no soaking required, simplifying prep for MS limitations ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
- **Cost Efficiency**: Budget of ~$82.39–$92.39 achieved with nutrient-dense, low-cost foods (eggs, tinned fish, beef, potatoes, frozen broccoli, kiwi) and minimal staples, saving ~$10–$30 vs. Plan A (~$100–$110) ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **Customization**: Swap kiwi with oranges (~10–20 mg flavonoids/100 g, ~$2.50/1000 g) if bloating occurs; reduce beef to 50 g/meal if digestive issues; increase potatoes to 250 g/meal if fiber <30 g/day; consult dietitian if nutrient deficits detected ([Article9.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact9.md)).
