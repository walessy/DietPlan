# Artifact 8: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Sleep and Recovery

## Sleep and Recovery

This is **Artifact 8: Sleep and Recovery**, outlining strategies to optimize sleep and recovery for a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients**, supporting mitochondrial health and cognitive function. For menu, see **Artifact 14** (./Article14.md); for routine, see **Artifact 2** (./Article2.md).

### Sleep Strategies

1. **Nutrient Support**:
   - **Choline**: Eggs (~500–625 mg/day) support acetylcholine, enhancing sleep ([Nutrients, 2018](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/11/1729)).
   - **Magnesium**: Seeds, lentils (~388.68 mg/day) reduce spasticity, promote relaxation ([Nutrients, 2017](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/7/767)).
   - **Flavonoids**: Strawberries, green tea (~249.14–480.78 mg/day) support cognitive health ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

2. **Routine**:
   - **Dim Lights (9:30 PM)**: Reduces melatonin suppression.
   - **Meditation (10:00 PM)**: 5 min body scan (Calm app) reduces stress ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
   - **Cool Room (10:30 PM)**: ~60–67°F enhances sleep quality.

3. **Fasting Schedule**: 16:8 fasting (8 PM–12 PM) aligns with circadian rhythm, supporting sirtuins ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).

### Notes
- **Monitoring**: Track sleep quality, hours via **MySymptoms** ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Adjustments**: Limit evening water to reduce nocturia ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
