# Artifact 5: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Shopping List

## Shopping List

This is **Artifact 5: Shopping List**, supporting the 7-day meal plan for June 15–21, 2025, tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g cooked), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level). Items are sourced from ASDA on Thursday, June 12, 2025, with a budget of ~£61.12–£62.79 (food-only, excluding supplements), slightly above the original ~£56–£59 due to increased eggs (15 vs. 12 for choline benefits), salmon, blueberries, tart cherries, and magnesium citrate. User observations highlight eggs (2–4/day, ~250–500 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, while chicken may cause hard stools, mitigated by increased fiber (~30–35g/day, e.g., zucchini, ~660g/week). Apples and cocoa are excluded due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants causing brain fog, digestive discomfort, and worsened neuropathy. The plan supports ~102g protein/day, ~350g kale/week, ~3,700–4,300 mg potassium/day, and neuropathy prevention. Prices are estimated based on 2025 ASDA averages ([USDA, 2023](https://www.usda.gov/), [SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
