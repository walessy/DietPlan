# Artifact 11: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - mTOR Activation Guidance

## mTOR Activation Guidance

This is **Artifact 11: mTOR Activation Guidance**, providing strategies to optimize mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation for the 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, with weaker digestive motility impacting gut function. The plan adheres to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated by reducing intake and adding tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), neuropathy from apples/cocoa (excluded), and the use of whole chickens (2 x 1.45 kg) to source bones for bone broth. The menu, based on **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md), delivers ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, targeting ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal to activate mTOR for muscle preservation and nerve health. This artifact outlines dietary (leucine-rich foods) and exercise strategies to enhance mTOR activation, supporting digestion and MS management, with shopping ordered online at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, and delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**.

### Importance of mTOR Activation in MS

- **mTOR Role**: The mTOR pathway regulates protein synthesis, supporting muscle maintenance, nerve repair, and reducing MS-related fatigue and spasticity ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/6/876/4615628)).
- **Activation Triggers**: Leucine-rich meals (~2.5–3.5 g/meal) and resistance exercise post-meal stimulate mTOR, critical for MS patients to counter muscle loss ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **User Context**: Weaker digestion requires balanced leucine intake to avoid gut overload, with exercise tailored for MS physical limitations ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

### mTOR Activation Strategies

#### Dietary Leucine Intake
- **Target**: ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal (~5–7 g/day), ensuring ~57.5 g protein/meal to activate mTOR ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/6/876/4615628)).
- **Sources**:
  - **Eggs**: ~0.5–0.6 g leucine/egg; 4 eggs/meal provide ~2.0–2.4 g leucine ([USDA FoodData Central, 2018](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/)).
  - **Tinned Sardines/Mackerel**: ~1.8–2.0 g leucine/100 g (Sunday/Tuesday/Friday lunch) ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
  - **Chicken (from whole chickens)**: ~2.0–2.3 g leucine/100 g (11 meals/week) ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
  - **Chicken Liver**: ~1.5–1.8 g leucine/50 g (Monday lunch) ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
- **Implementation**:
  - **Lunch (12 PM)**:
    - Sunday/Tuesday/Friday: 4 eggs (~2.0–2.4 g leucine) + 100 g tinned fish (~1.8–2.0 g) = ~3.8–4.4 g leucine.
    - Monday: 4 eggs (~2.0–2.4 g) + 50 g liver (~1.5–1.8 g) + 100 g chicken (~2.0–2.3 g) = ~3.5–4.2 g leucine.
    - Wednesday/Thursday/Saturday: 4 eggs (~2.0–2.4 g) + 100 g chicken (~2.0–2.3 g) = ~4.0–4.7 g leucine.
  - **Dinner (7:30–8:00 PM)**: 4 eggs (~2.0–2.4 g) + 100 g chicken (~2.0–2.3 g) = ~4.0–4.7 g leucine (all days).
  - Total: ~5–7 g leucine/day, exceeding mTOR threshold ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
- **Digestion**: Spread leucine evenly (lunch/dinner) to minimize gut stress, supported by fiber (~15–17.5 g/meal) from avocados, pear, zucchini ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Compatibility**: Low-histamine (fresh), lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP, MS-supportive ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).

#### Post-Meal Resistance Exercise
- **Purpose**: Enhances mTOR activation by synergizing with leucine, promoting muscle protein synthesis and nerve health ([Physiother Res Int., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.2087)).
- **Protocol**:
  - **Timing**: 12:30 PM and 8:00–8:30 PM (post-lunch/dinner) ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
  - **Duration**: 30 min/session (5 min warm-up, 25 min workout).
  - **Exercises**: 10 sets (2 sets each, 8–12 reps, 60–90 sec rest):
    - Band squats (seated, for legs).
    - Chair push-ups (upper body).
    - Seated band rows (back).
    - Seated leg lifts (core).
    - Seated knee extensions (quads) ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).
- **Implementation**:
  - Use resistance bands or bodyweight, adjust for MS fatigue.
  - Perform post-meal to leverage leucine peak (~30–60 min after eating).
  - Ensure hydration (300 ml water post-exercise) to support digestion.
- **Compatibility**: MS-safe, low-impact, supports digestion via movement ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

### Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Track**:
  - **Cronometer**: Log protein (~115 g/day), leucine (~2.5–3.5 g/meal, ~5–7 g/day), verify post-meal exercise timing ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
  - **MySymptoms**: Log:
    - **Fatigue**: Energy (1–10 scale) post-exercise, meals.
    - **Muscle Strength**: Perceived strength (1–10 scale) post-exercise.
    - **Constipation**: Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Chart, Type 3–4 ideal) post-meals.
    - **Bloating**: Discomfort (1–10 scale) post-meals.
    - **Spasticity**: Stiffness (1–10 scale) post-exercise ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Adjust**:
  - **Leucine/Fatigue**: If leucine below 2.5 g/meal or fatigue >2, increase chicken to 125 g/serving, consult dietitian ([Article7.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact7.md)).
  - **Muscle Strength**: If strength <5, reduce reps to 6–8 or add rest day, consult physiotherapist ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).
  - **Constipation**: Increase avocado to 50 g/serving, pear to 100 g/serving to support digestion ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
  - **Bloating**: Reduce tinned fish to 75 g/serving, ensure small avocado portions (30 g) ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
  - **Spasticity**: Reduce exercise intensity (e.g., 1 set/exercise), extend yoga to 10 min if stiffness >2 ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Consult**: Share **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms** data with dietitian/neurologist/physiotherapist after 1–2 weeks ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **SuperGrok**: Query for mTOR optimization (e.g., “MS-safe leucine exercise combos”) or digestion support (e.g., “Low-FODMAP foods for mTOR”). Available via **SuperGrok** subscription on grok.com (visit https://x.ai/grok for pricing) ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).

### Notes

- **Synergies**: Leucine-rich meals (eggs, tinned fish, chicken) and post-meal exercise maximize mTOR activation, supporting muscle and nerve health ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **Digestive Support**: High-fiber foods (avocados, pear, ~30–35 g/day) and bone broth address weaker motility, with exercise aiding gut function ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Whole Chickens**: Two 1.45 kg chickens provide meat (~1100 g for 11 meals) and bone broth (~2000 ml) ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **AIP Compliance**: Nightshade-free, includes liver, yogurt ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Accessibility**: Clear dietary and exercise guidance accommodates MS cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
