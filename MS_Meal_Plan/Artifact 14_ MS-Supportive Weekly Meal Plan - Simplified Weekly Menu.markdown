# Artifact 14: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Simplified Weekly Menu

## Simplified Weekly Menu

This is **Artifact 14: Simplified Weekly Menu**, providing a concise overview of a 7-day meal plan (June 25–July 1, 2025) tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, focusing on **mitochondrial health** to support energy, mobility, cognitive function, and symptom management. The plan favors **lower histamine**, **lower oxalates**, and **lower antinutrients** (e.g., lectins, phytates), with no strict dietary restrictions, delivering \~115 g protein/day (\~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule. It enhances **ADP/ATP cycles**, **NAD/NADH** and **FAD/FADH2 cycles**, **mitophagy**, **sirtuin** activation, and **telomere** maintenance through dietary cofactors (**thiamine**, **riboflavin**, **niacin**, **pantothenic acid**, **pyridoxine**, **biotin**, **cobalamin**, **phosphorus**, **magnesium**, **iron**, **copper**, **manganese**, **zinc**, **selenium**, **potassium**) and bioactive compounds (**genistein** from tofu, **EGCG** from green tea, **curcumin** from turmeric, **alpha-lipoic acid** from broccoli, **acetic acid** from vinegar), while reducing **mTOR activity** to mitigate MS-related inflammation, fatigue, spasticity, and neurodegeneration. The menu is designed to address user preferences, including eggs for alertness/sleep, tinned fish/avocados for gut health, minimal chicken to avoid constipation, exclusion of apples/cocoa due to neuropathy, and flavonoid-rich foods (strawberries, blueberries) for neuroprotection. Shopping is ordered at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 17, 2025**, for delivery on **Friday evening, June 20, 2025**, totaling \~$128.93–$133.60.
