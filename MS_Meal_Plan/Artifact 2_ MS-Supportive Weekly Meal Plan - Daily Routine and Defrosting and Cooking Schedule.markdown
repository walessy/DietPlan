# Artifact 2: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

## Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

This is **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule**, detailing the daily schedule, including defrosting, cooking, exercise, and stress management tasks for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 71.8 kg, with weaker digestive motility impacting gut function. The plan aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** principles, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated by reducing intake and adding tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), neuropathy from apples/cocoa (excluded), and the use of whole chickens (2 x 1.45 kg) to source bones for bone broth. This artifact provides a consolidated daily timeline, incorporating defrosting, cooking, exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements at 12:30 PM and 8:00–8:30 PM), yoga, and meditation, using the simplified menu from **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md) (eggs, tinned fish, chicken, zucchini, lettuce, avocados, blueberries, pear, liver, yogurt, bone broth). It prioritizes gut-healing and high-fiber foods (~30–35 g fiber/day) to support impaired digestion, with shopping ordered online at ASDA on **Tuesday, June 10, 2025**, and delivery on **Friday evening, June 13, 2025**. For menu, see **Artifact 15** (./Article15.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for food compatibility, see **Artifact 6** (./Article6.md); for tracking, see **Artifact 10** (./Article10.md); for exercise details, see **Artifact 12** (./Article12.md); for AIP, see **Artifact 13** (./Article13.md).

### Daily Routine and Schedule

**Notes**:
- **Whole Chickens**: Two 1.45 kg chickens yield ~1800 g meat (~450 g protein, ~1100 g used for 11 meals, ~700 g excess frozen) and ~1400 g bones for ~2000 ml bone broth (10 x 200 ml), supporting gut health ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **Digestive Support**: Bone broth (200 ml/meal), avocados, blueberries, pear, and yogurt address weaker intestinal motility, with yoga/exercise enhancing gut function ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Prep Simplicity**: Meals use minimal ingredients, cooked fresh to maintain low-histamine properties ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
- **Exercise**: 10 sets of MS-adjusted movements (e.g., seated band squats, chair push-ups) post-meal to support mTOR activation and mobility ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).
- **Monitoring**: Log constipation (Bristol Stool Chart), sleep, neuropathy, bloating in **MySymptoms**; track nutrients in **Cronometer** ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Hydration**: 3 L/day water, sipped, limited post-6:00 PM to reduce nocturia ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).

### Monitoring and Adjustments

- **Track**:
  - **Cronometer**: Log protein (~115 g/day), leucine (~5–7 g/day), fiber (~30–35 g/day), potassium (~3,700–4,300 mg/day), choline (~500–625 mg/day) ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
  - **MySymptoms**: Log:
    - **Constipation**: Stool consistency (Bristol Stool Chart, Type 3–4 ideal) post-tinned fish, avocado, pear.
    - **Sleep**: Hours, quality (1–10 scale) post-eggs, blueberries.
    - **Neuropathy**: Tingling (1–10 scale) post-blueberries.
    - **Bloating**: Discomfort (1–10 scale) post-avocado, yogurt.
    - **Inflammation**: Fatigue, spasticity (1–10 scale) post-liver, yoga ([Article10.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact10.md)).
- **Adjust**:
  - **Constipation**: Increase avocado to 50 g/serving, pear to 100 g/serving, or magnesium citrate to 400 mg ([Article15.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact15.md)).
  - **Sleep**: Add blueberries (75 g) to Monday/Thursday dinner, extend meditation to 10 min ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
  - **Neuropathy**: Reduce blueberries to 50 g (~12.3 mg oxalates), ensure nightshade-free diet ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md)).
  - **Bloating**: Reduce avocado to 20 g/serving, discontinue yogurt, substitute pear ([www.monashfodmap.com](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
  - **Inflammation**: Increase liver to 75 g/serving (once/week), extend yoga to 10 min ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Consult**: Share **Cronometer**/**MySymptoms** data with dietitian/neurologist after 1–2 weeks ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

### Notes

- **Digestive Support**: Bone broth, avocados, blueberries, pear, and yogurt address weaker intestinal motility, with yoga/exercise enhancing gut function ([Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).
- **Whole Chickens**: Two 1.45 kg chickens provide meat (~1100 g for 11 meals, ~700 g excess frozen) and bones (~2000 ml bone broth) ([Article5.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact5.md)).
- **AIP Compliance**: Nightshade-free, includes liver (once/week), yogurt (twice/week), bone broth, meditation, yoga ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Accessibility**: Simplified tasks and clear timeline accommodate MS cognitive/physical needs ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- **Flavonoids**: Blueberries reduce inflammation, monitored for oxalates (~18.5 mg/75 g) ([News-Medical, 2025](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250326/Flavonoids-help-regulate-gut-hormones-and-show-promise-in-managing-type-2-diabetes.aspx)).
