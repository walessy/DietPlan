# Artifact 2: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

## Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

This is **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule**, detailing the daily schedule and food preparation tasks for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.8 kg. The plan aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) and incorporates **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** elements, delivering ~115 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.5 g/meal) across two meals (12 PM lunch, 7:30–8:00 PM dinner) within a 16:8 intermittent fasting schedule, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints. User observations highlight eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chronic constipation from chicken and kale (mitigated with tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoid-rich foods), and neuropathy from apples/cocoa. The plan targets ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal for mTOR activation, supported by 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements) at 12:30 PM and 8:00–8:30 PM ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)). This artifact schedules meal preparation, defrosting, and cooking to align with the updated menu, incorporating tinned fish, avocados, blueberries, tart cherries, and pear to address constipation, while maintaining chicken liver, coconut yogurt, and nightshade elimination ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)). Foods are cooked fresh and consumed immediately to maintain low-histamine properties ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)). For plan overview, see **Artifact 1** (./Article1.md); for menu details, see **Artifact 3** (./Article3.md); for shopping, see **Artifact 5** (./Article5.md); for food compatibility, see **Artifact 6** (./Article6.md); for AIP integration, see **Artifact 13** (./Article13.md).

### Daily Routine
- **6:30 AM**: Wake, hydrate (300 ml water).
- **7:00 AM**: Seated yoga (5 min, e.g., cat-cow stretch: sit, inhale to arch back, exhale to round spine, 8 reps) to reduce stress and spasticity ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **7:30–8:00 AM**: Morning exercise (20–30 min, resistance bands, walking, MS-adjusted) to support circulation and circadian rhythm ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).
- **8:00 AM–12:00 PM**: Fasting (16:8, hydrate with 1.5 L water, sipped), perform light activities (e.g., reading, stretching).
- **11:30 AM**: Morning cooking prep (see daily tasks below).
- **12:00 PM**: Lunch (~57.5 g protein, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine, e.g., tinned fish, eggs, avocado) ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
- **12:30 PM**: Post-meal exercise (30 min, 10 sets compound movements, e.g., band squats, chair push-ups) ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).
- **1:00–6:00 PM**: Hydrate (1.2 L water, sipped), light activities, evening defrosting (see daily tasks).
- **6:00 PM**: Limit water to reduce nocturia.
- **7:00 PM**: Evening cooking prep (see daily tasks).
- **7:30–8:00 PM**: Dinner (~57.5 g protein, ~2.5–3.5 g leucine, e.g., chicken, eggs, blueberries) ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
- **8:00–8:30 PM**: Post-meal exercise (30 min, 10 sets compound movements) ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).
- **9:30–10:00 PM**: Evening routine: dim lights, avoid screens to boost melatonin ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
- **10:00 PM**: Mindfulness meditation (5 min, e.g., guided body scan via Calm app) ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **10:00–10:30 PM**: Diaphragmatic breathing (5 min, 4 sec inhale, 6 sec exhale), bathroom visit.
- **10:30 PM**: Bedtime, dark, quiet, cool room (~60–67°F) for ~7–8 hours sleep ([Article8.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact8.md)).
- **Hydration Total**: 3 L/day water, sipped, limited post-6:00 PM to prevent sleep disruption ([Article2.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact2.md)).
- **Note**: Routine supports fasting, leucine-driven mTOR activation, and constipation relief via tinned fish, avocados, and flavonoids. Monitor fatigue, adjust exercise to 8 sets if needed ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

### Notes
- **Constipation Management**: Tinned fish, avocados, blueberries, tart cherries, and pear enhance fiber (~30–35 g/day) and gut motility, replacing high-constipation chicken/kale. Monitor stool consistency with **MySymptoms** (e.g., Bristol Stool Chart) to confirm improvements ([Article3.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact3.md)).
- **Histamine/FODMAP Monitoring**: Check tinned fish (use low-histamine brands, e.g., Wild Planet), avocados (limit to 30 g), and berries (monitor oxalates) for tolerance. Log symptoms (e.g., flushing, bloating) with **Cronometer** to adjust quantities if needed (e.g., reduce fish to 50 g/serving) ([Article6.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact6.md]).
- **Leucine/Exercise Synergy**: Cooking supports leucine-rich meals (e.g., tinned fish ~1.8–2.0 g/100 g, eggs ~2.0–2.4 g/4 eggs) for 12:30 PM/8:00–8:30 PM exercise, enhancing mTOR activation ([Article11.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact11.md)).
- **AIP Compliance**: Includes liver, coconut yogurt, nightshade-free prep, and meditation/yoga, aligning with **Article13.md** for inflammation reduction ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Accessibility**: Simplified tasks and clear timing accommodate MS cognitive/physical needs, ensuring ease of preparation ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
