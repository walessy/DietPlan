# Artifact 7: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Non-Plan Content

## Non-Plan Content

This is **Artifact 7: Non-Plan Content**, providing additional context and rationale for food choices in the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g cooked), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level). This artifact summarizes the deeper search reevaluation for **blueberries** (~50g/sitting) and **tart cherries** (~30g/sitting), explains the inclusion of compatible foods (**celery, wild Alaskan salmon, garlic, blueberries, eggs, tart cherries, sea vegetables, zucchini**), and justifies the exclusion of incompatible foods (**beetroot, shiitake mushrooms, green tea, almond butter, pumpkin seeds, whey protein, apples, cocoa**). User observations highlight eggs (2–4/day, ~250–500 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, chicken causing hard stools (mitigated by fiber, e.g., zucchini), and apples/cocoa triggering brain fog, digestive discomfort, and neuropathy due to oxalates and stimulants. It complements the plan’s core components.

### Reevaluation of Blueberries and Tart Cherries

#### Blueberries (~50g/sitting, Wednesday/Friday)
- **Rationale**: Blueberries (~50g/sitting, ~0.5 cup raw) were included as a colorful fruit for antioxidants (anthocyanins) to support MS neuroprotection and reduce oxidative stress, per **The Wahls Protocol** ([Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/blueberries), [PubMed, 2012](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22243431/), [Artifact 4: Nerve Health Support](./Article4.md)). A deeper search reevaluated compatibility due to moderate oxalate content and user-reported neuropathy risks from high-oxalate foods.
- **Histamine**: Low-histamine when fresh, consumed immediately, stored at 35–40°F ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Lectins**: Lectin-free, no skin/seed concerns ([The Wahls Protocol, 2020](https://terrywahls.com/)).
- **Oxalates**: ~24.67 mg/100g (~12.5 mg/50g), exceeding the <10 mg/100g threshold, requiring monitoring for kidney stone risk (~50–100 mg/day safe total oxalate intake) ([The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/), [Artifact 3: Menu](./Article3.md)).
- **FODMAP**: Low-FODMAP at ~40g/sitting; ~50g may cause bloating in sensitive individuals, requiring monitoring ([Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Leaky Gut/MS**: Anthocyanins reduce inflammation, supporting leaky gut and MS nerve health. No dairy/gluten concerns ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)). User experience with apples (~20–30 mg oxalates/182g) suggests oxalate sensitivity, reinforcing caution.
- **Implementation**: Limited to Wednesday/Friday (lunch, ~50g/sitting) to balance benefits and risks. Monitor for bloating, urinary discomfort, or neuropathy exacerbation (e.g., tingling, brain fog, as seen with apple/cocoa). Reduce to 40g/sitting if symptoms occur ([Artifact 3: Menu](./Article3.md)).

#### Tart Cherries (~30g/sitting, Thursday/Friday)
- **Rationale**: Tart cherries (~30g/sitting, ~0.3 cup raw) were included for melatonin (~0.01–0.06 mg/sitting) and antioxidants to support deep sleep and reduce inflammation, aiding MS fatigue and nerve repair ([Antioxidants, 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/1/17), [Artifact 4: Nerve Health Support](./Article4.md), [Artifact 9: Notes 4](./Article9.md)). A deeper search confirmed compatibility.
- **Histamine**: Low-histamine when fresh, consumed immediately, stored at 35–40°F ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Lectins**: Lectin-free, no skin/seed concerns ([The Wahls Protocol, 2020](https://terrywahls.com/)).
- **Oxalates**: ~10–15 mg/100g (~3–4.5 mg/30g), within <10 mg/100g threshold, safe for MS and leaky gut ([Livestrong](https://www.livestrong.com/article/483063-oxalate-content-of-various-foods/), [Artifact 3: Menu](./Article3.md)).
- **FODMAP**: Low-FODMAP at ~30g/sitting, safe for most ([Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Leaky Gut/MS**: Melatonin and antioxidants support sleep and inflammation reduction, beneficial for MS ([Antioxidants, 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/1/17)). No adverse effects reported, unlike apples/cocoa.
- **Implementation**: Included Thursday/Friday (dinner, ~30g/sitting) for sleep synergy with magnesium citrate (~200–400 mg/day). Monitor for FODMAP sensitivity (unlikely at ~30g) or oxalate-related symptoms (e.g., urinary discomfort) ([Artifact 3: Menu](./Article3.md), [Artifact 9: Notes 4](./Article9.md)).

### Compatible Foods
The following foods were included for their alignment with plan constraints and MS benefits:
- **Celery (~50g/sitting)**: Low-histamine, lectin-free, low-FODMAP (~45g safe), oxalate-free (~2–5 mg/100g). Apigenin enhances nitric oxide, supporting nerve health ([Nutrients, 2019](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/8/1900), [Artifact 4: Nerve Health Support](./Article4.md)).
- **Wild Alaskan Salmon (~100g/sitting)**: Low-histamine when fresh, no reheating. Lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP.

Iodine (~80–200 µg/20g) supports thyroid function ([Nutrients, 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/6/1718), [Artifact 4: Nerve Health Support](./Article4.md)).
- **Zucchini (~100g/sitting)**: Low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free (~1–2 mg/100g), low-FODMAP. Fiber (~1 g/100g) supports digestion, preventing constipation from high-protein foods like chicken ([Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/), [Nutr Rev., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/nutritionreviews/article/79/6/672/5897345)).

### Incompatible Foods
The following foods were excluded due to incompatibility with plan constraints, with user observations reinforcing risks:
- **Beetroot**: High oxalate (~40–60 mg/100g), moderate FODMAP (fructans), potential histamine issues when stored. Excluded to avoid kidney stone risk and digestive issues ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/), [Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Shiitake Mushrooms**: High histamine (especially dried), moderate FODMAP (mannitol), potential lectins. Excluded to prevent histamine reactions and digestive discomfort ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/), [Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/)).
- **Green Tea**: Contains caffeine, a potential histamine liberator, and moderate oxalates (~10–20 mg/100ml). Excluded to avoid histamine and oxalate risks ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).
- **Almond Butter**: High oxalate (~200–300 mg/100g), high FODMAP (GOS), contains lectins. Excluded to prevent kidney stone risk, digestive issues, and leaky gut aggravation ([Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/), [The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **Pumpkin Seeds**: High oxalate (~100–150 mg/100g), moderate FODMAP (fructans), high lectins. Excluded to avoid kidney stone risk and leaky gut issues ([Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/), [The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **Whey Protein**: Dairy-based, high histamine, potential FODMAP (lactose), unsuitable for leaky gut or MS (dairy-free protocol). Excluded to prevent inflammation and digestive issues ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/), [The Wahls Protocol, 2020](https://terrywahls.com/)).
- **Apples**: Moderate oxalate (~20–30 mg/182g), high FODMAP (fructose, ~125g safe, 182g excessive), potential histamine issues when stored. Excluded due to user-reported brain fog, digestive discomfort (e.g., “stones” sensation), and worsened neuropathy from oxalate and fructose load ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/), [Monash University, 2023](https://www.monashfodmap.com/), [The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).
- **Cocoa**: High oxalate (~600–700 mg/100g), potential histamine liberators (e.g., theobromine), moderate FODMAP (fructans in some forms). Excluded due to user-reported brain fog, digestive discomfort, and neuropathy exacerbation from oxalate load and theobromine stimulation ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/), [The Kidney Dietitian](https://www.thekidneydietitian.org/low-oxalate-fruit/)).

### Additional Notes
- **Monitoring**: Track symptoms (e.g., bloating, urinary discomfort, neuropathy, brain fog) in a diary when consuming blueberries (~50g/sitting), tart cherries (~30g/sitting), or high-protein foods like chicken. User experience with apples/cocoa underscores the need for vigilance with oxalates and stimulants. Consult a dietitian if oxalate (e.g., urinary pain), FODMAP (e.g., bloating), or neurological symptoms (e.g., tingling, fog) arise ([Artifact 3: Menu](./Article3.md)).
- **Synergies**: Tart cherries (Thursday/Friday dinner) pair with magnesium citrate (~200–400 mg/day) for sleep benefits, enhancing nerve repair ([Artifact 9: Notes 4](./Article9.md)). Eggs (2–4/day) provide choline for cognitive clarity, complementing exercise ([Artifact 4: Nerve Health Support](./Article4.md)). Zucchini (~100g/sitting) supports digestion, reducing inflammation from high-protein intake ([Artifact 3: Menu](./Article3.md)).
