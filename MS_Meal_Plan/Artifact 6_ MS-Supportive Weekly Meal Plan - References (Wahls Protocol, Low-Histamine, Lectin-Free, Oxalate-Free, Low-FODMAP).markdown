# Artifact 6: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - References

## References

This is **Artifact 6: References**, providing scientific and authoritative sources for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS, adhering to **low-histamine**, **lectin-free**, **oxalate-free** (<10 mg/100g cooked), **low-FODMAP**, **leaky gut**, and **MS-supportive** constraints, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level). These references support the nutritional standards, food choices, supplementation, fasting, and lifestyle recommendations, updated with user observations: eggs (2–4/day, ~250–500 mg choline) improve alertness and sleep, chicken may cause constipation (mitigated by ~30–35g fiber/day, e.g., zucchini), and apples/cocoa are excluded due to oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants causing brain fog and neuropathy. For the meal plan overview, see **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards** (./Article1.md); for meal details, see **Artifact 3: Menu** (./Article3.md); for preparation, see **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule** (./Article2.md); for nerve health, see **Artifact 4: Nerve Health Support** (./Article4.md); for sourcing, see **Artifact 5: Shopping List** (./Article5.md); for food compatibility, see **Artifact 7: Non-Plan Content** (./Article7.md).
