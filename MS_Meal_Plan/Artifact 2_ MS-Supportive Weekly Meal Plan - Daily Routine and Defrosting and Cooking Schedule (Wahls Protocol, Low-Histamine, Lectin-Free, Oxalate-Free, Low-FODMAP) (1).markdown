# Artifact 2: MS-Supportive Weekly Meal Plan - Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

## Daily Routine

This is **Artifact 2: Daily Routine and Defrosting and Cooking Schedule**, detailing the daily schedule and food preparation for the 7-day meal plan (June 15–21, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with MS weighing 71.7 kg. The plan supports **16:8 intermittent fasting**, ~114.7 g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg, ~57.4 g/meal), ~30–35 g/day fiber (increased to prevent constipation from chicken), and neuropathy prevention, aligned with **The Wahls Protocol** and incorporating **Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** elements for inflammation reduction and gut health ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)). User observations note eggs (4–5/day, ~500–625 mg choline) improving alertness and sleep, while chicken may cause hard stools, mitigated with increased fiber (e.g., zucchini, ~100 g/sitting, ~1 g fiber) and hydration (3 L/day). Apples and cocoa are avoided due to high oxalates, FODMAPs, and stimulants causing brain fog and neuropathy. The plan includes 30-minute post-meal exercise (10 sets of MS-adjusted compound movements, e.g., bodyweight squats, resistance band rows) after lunch (12:30 PM) and dinner (8:00–8:30 PM) to enhance mTOR activation with ~2.5–3.5 g leucine/meal, supporting muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and nerve health ([Am J Clin Nutr., 2015](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/101/3/479/4499917)). AIP-aligned stress management includes 5-minute mindfulness meditation (~10:00 PM) and 5-minute seated yoga (~7:00 AM) to improve sleep and reduce spasticity ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)). For meal details, see **Artifact 3: Menu** (./Article3.md); for nutritional standards, see **Artifact 1: Introduction and Nutritional Standards** (./Article1.md); for exercise routine, see **Artifact 12: Post-Meal Exercise Routine** (./Article12.md); for AIP integration, see **Artifact 13: Autoimmune Protocol Integration** (./Article13.md). Use Markdown Reader (https://markdownreader.github.io/) to view ([Physiother Res Int., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.2087)).

**Morning Ritual** (~6:30–8:00 AM):
- **Wake**: ~6:30 AM, after ~8 hours sleep (~10:30 PM–6:30 AM) to reduce MS fatigue and support circadian alignment ([Sleep Med Rev., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079217301551)).
- **Hydration**: 300 ml water upon waking, critical for MS bladder/gut function and constipation prevention ([The Wahls Protocol, 2020](https://terrywahls.com/)).
- **Stress Management**: 5 min seated yoga (~7:00 AM, e.g., cat-cow stretch: sit, inhale to arch back, exhale to round spine, 8 reps, hold chair for stability) to reduce spasticity and stress, per AIP principles ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/), [Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- **Non-Dietary**: Diaphragmatic breathing (5 min, 2x/day, morning and evening); stand/walk 5–10 min/hour, MS-adjusted ([Physiother Res Int., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.2087)). **No food** (fasting).
- **Exercise**: 20–30 min/day (~7:30–8:00 AM, resistance bands, walking, MS-adjusted), boosts nitric oxide/myokines for nerve health ([Nitric Oxide, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1089860318300146)). Post-meal exercise (30 min after lunch and dinner, 10 sets compound movements) further enhances mTOR activation ([Article12.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact12.md)).

**Fasting**: 16:8 (12 PM–8 PM eating, fasting 8 PM–12 PM), two meals (~57.4 g protein/meal, ~120–150 g fat, ~1,500–1,600 kcal) ([Neurosci News, 2018](https://neurosciencenews.com/intermittent-fasting-neuroprotection-9845)). For fasting guidance, see **Artifact 7: Notes 2 - Leucine and Fasting Guidance** (./Article7.md). Hydration: 3 L water/day, sipped to support digestion and prevent constipation, limited after ~6:00 PM to minimize nocturia ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).

**Supplements and Spirulina**:
- **Lunch (12 PM)**: 300 mg R-Alpha Lipoic Acid (~£0.50), 150 mg Benfotiamine (~£0.15), 40 mg Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate (~£0.11), 500 µg Methylcobalamin (~£0.08, sublingual), 200 µg 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate (~£0.10), 500 mg L-Citrulline (~£0.05), 500 mg Acetyl-L-Carnitine (~£0.25), 5 g Creatine Monohydrate (~£0.05), 30 ml Plenish Spirulina Detox (~£1.14). For sourcing, see **Artifact 5: Shopping List** (./Article5.md).
- **Dinner (7:30–8:00 PM)**: Same as lunch, plus 200–400 mg magnesium citrate (~£0.10–£0.20) to enhance deep sleep and bowel regularity, addressing chicken-related constipation ([Nutrients, 2017](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/9/7/767)). Leucine (~2.5–3.5 g/meal from ~150 g chicken, 4–5 eggs, or ~100 g salmon) is timed ~3–3.5 hours before bed (~10:30 PM) for overnight MPS ([J Nutr., 2014](https://academic.oup.com/jn/article/144/6/876/4615628)).
- **Storage**: Refrigerate supplements/spirulina at 35–40°F to maintain low-histamine properties ([SIGHI, 2023](https://www.histamineintolerance.org/)).

**Evening Routine** (~9:30–10:30 PM):
- ~9:30–10:00 PM: Dim lights, avoid screens (reduce blue light) to boost melatonin ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- ~10:00 PM: 5 min mindfulness meditation (e.g., guided body scan via Calm app, sit comfortably, focus on breath) to reduce stress and enhance sleep, per AIP principles ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)).
- ~10:00–10:30 PM: Diaphragmatic breathing (5 min) to relax and reduce spasticity ([Mult Scler., 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5405816/)).
- ~10:30 PM: Bathroom visit to minimize nocturia ([J Neurol., 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682957/)).
- **Bedtime**: ~10:30 PM, in a dark, quiet, cool room (~60–67°F) with a supportive mattress to reduce spasticity ([Sleep Med Rev., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079217301551)).

**Non-Dietary Tip**: Use a footstool during bowel movements to reduce straining, aiding constipation relief ([Physiother Res Int., 2024](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/pri.2087/)).

**Store Notes**: ASDA items (receipt, June 12, 2025): salt, olive oil, celery, zucchini, parsley, potato, kale (350 g), carrots, cabbage, blueberries (100 g), tart cherries (60 g), radishes, lettuce, bok choy, garlic, ginger, sea vegetables, chicken, salmon, eggs, chicken liver (100 g), coconut yogurt (100 ml), spirulina (Fresh Produce, Meat, Fish, Juice, International Aisles); magnesium citrate (Pharmacy/Online). Peel zucchini, carrots, potato, ginger to remove lectins. Avoid apples, cocoa, nightshades (e.g., tomatoes, peppers) due to oxalates, FODMAPs, and neurological risks, per AIP principles ([Article13.md](https://github.com/xAI/Artifact13.md)). For sourcing, see **Artifact 5: Shopping List** (./Article5.md).

## Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

This section outlines the defrosting and cooking schedule to ensure low-histamine compliance and alignment with the 12 PM–8 PM eating window.
