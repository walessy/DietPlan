# Introduction

This cost-optimized 7-day meal plan (Friday to Thursday, May 9–15, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 63.5 kg, aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) to support MS management through nutrient-dense foods, delivering ~102g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg body weight, ~51g/meal) across two meals (12 PM, 6 PM) within a **16:8 intermittent fasting schedule** (12 PM–8 PM eating window, fasting 8 PM–12 PM, no breakfast or morning food intake). It ensures all 9 essential amino acids (EAAs: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine) and Vitamin B12 (~2.5–3.0µg/day, ~104–125% RDA: 2.4µg), supporting leaky gut repair, constipation, bowel-bladder interactions, acidic sensations, neuropathic pain, post-antibiotic gut issues, and MS-specific needs (e.g., nerve health, inflammation reduction). The plan aligns with the video *"Ultimate Protein Guide: Lose Weight Faster (How Much You REALLY Need)"* ([https://youtu.be/hHkxBEQaZdY](https://youtu.be/hHkxBEQaZdY)), recommending ~1.2–2.0 g/kg protein (*Am J Clin Nutr.*, 2015; *Adv Nutr.*, 2017), and leverages fasting benefits for inflammation reduction and immune regulation in MS (*Neurosci News*, 2018; *Nat Commun.*, 2018), with high protein to mitigate muscle loss concerns for those over 40 (*J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci.*, 2017; *J Nutr.*, 2014).

The plan uses only **whole chicken** (for meat and bones) and **chicken breasts**, with all but one whole chicken frozen upon purchase (Friday) and defrosted strategically to ensure low-histamine compliance. All chicken is cooked fresh daily or consumed immediately, with **no reheating of cooked meat** to prevent histamine formation, and excess meat is frozen within 2 hours (*SIGHI*, 2023; *Food Microbiol.*, 2018). Bone broth (~2800ml, 14 x 200ml portions) is prepared from ~1400g whole chicken bones, frozen immediately, defrosted daily, and heated once to 165°F/74°C. The plan includes ~9 cups/day raw vegetables (~4.5–6 cups cooked, ~600–800g): ~3 cups greens (kale), ~3 cups sulfur-rich (cabbage), ~3 cups colorful (peeled carrots, cucumber, peeled white potato, apple), all oxalate-free (<10mg/100g cooked), lectin-free (peeled where needed), and low-FODMAP, plus anti-inflammatory fats (olive oil), seasoned with turmeric. Parsley is used sparingly (~25g/week, ~25–37.5mg oxalates, negligible). No breakfast occurs, with non-food morning rituals (hydration, breathing) supporting MS health.

The plan manages **20 bags of kale** (~3,000g, ~150g/bag) by using ~700–1,050g/week (~100–150g/day cooked, ~2–10.5 mg oxalates/day, ~14–31.5 mg goitrogens/day, ~110–618 µg Vitamin K/day, ~200–600 mg potassium/day, ~1.7–3 g fiber/day), with ~17–18 bags (~2,550–2,700g) blanched and frozen to maintain low-histamine status. Kale (~2–7 mg/100g cooked) and cabbage (~0.5–2 mg/100g cooked) are oxalate-free, safe for MS/leaky gut (*Nutrients*, 2019). **Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALC)** is included via chicken (~9–15 mg L-carnitine/day), eggs (~0.4–1.5 mg/day), and a 1,000 mg/day supplement (500 mg/meal) to support MS fatigue and neuroprotection (*Nutrients*, 2018). Nutrient-dense foods provide ~340–390 mg magnesium/day, ~120–150 µg iodine/day (adjusted with 3 seaweed packs), and ~25–30 g fiber/day, supporting constipation, nerve health, and MS symptoms (*The Wahls Protocol*, 2020). Some nutrients (magnesium, calcium, Vitamin D, omega-3s) fall below RDA/AI due to constraints, requiring monitoring or supplementation (e.g., neurologist for Vitamin D). The plan adheres to low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP, gluten-free, dairy-free principles, with a budget of ~£56–£59 (~£54.61, including ~£4.70 delivery fee). The journal (Saturday, May 10: cooked 1.6kg whole chicken, ate ~400g chicken, 30g kale, 2 eggs, 400g sweet potato, 100g butternut squash, 100g cucumber, no olive oil/bone broth; 1:42 PM: 2 eggs, no olive oil) is reflected, replacing sweet potato with peeled white potato and butternut squash with cabbage.

## Daily Routine

**Morning Ritual (7 AM)**:
- Hydration: 300ml plain water (supports MS bladder/gut health, Wahls’ hydration focus).
- Non-Dietary: Diaphragmatic breathing (5 min, 2x/day) to relax pelvic floor; stand/walk 5–10 min/hour, adjusted for MS mobility, supporting Wahls’ stress reduction (*Physiother Res Int.*, 2024). **No food intake** (16:8 fasting, 8 PM–12 PM).

**Fasting Schedule**: 16:8 intermittent fasting (12 PM–8 PM eating window, fasting 8 PM–12 PM), two meals/day (12 PM lunch, 6 PM dinner) with ~102g protein (~51g/meal), ~120–150g fat, ~1,500–1,600 kcal, supporting MS inflammation reduction (*Neurosci News*, 2018). Hydration: 3L water/day.

**Non-Dietary Tip**: Use a footstool (e.g., Squatty Potty) during bowel movements to reduce straining, beneficial for MS bowel-bladder crosstalk. Consult a physiotherapist for mobility aids (*Physiother Res Int.*, 2024).

**Store Notes**: All items at Morrisons. Non-iodized sea salt (Maldon Sea Salt Flakes), olive oil, cucumber, peeled zucchini, parsley, peeled white potato, kale (150g bags, from your 20-bag stock), peeled carrots, cabbage, apple, whole chicken, chicken breasts, eggs, seaweed snacks, turmeric in Seasonings Aisle, Oil Aisle, Fresh Produce Aisle, Fresh Meat Aisle, International Aisle, Spices Aisle. Acetyl-L-Carnitine from pharmacy/online (e.g., Holland & Barrett). Peel zucchini, carrots, potato for lectin-free compliance.

## Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

All chicken (except one whole chicken refrigerated for next-day cooking) is frozen upon purchase. Defrosting occurs in the refrigerator (24–48 hours for 1.6kg whole chicken, 24 hours for ~500g chicken breasts). Chicken is cooked fresh daily or consumed immediately, with **no reheating** to prevent histamine formation. Excess raw meat is frozen within 2 hours if not cooked; cooked meat is frozen in 150g portions for future use, not this week’s meals. Bone broth (~2800ml, 14 x 200ml) is prepared from ~1400g whole chicken bones (Sunday), frozen immediately, defrosted daily (24 hours), and heated once to 165°F/74°C. Kale (~700–1,050g/week) is used fresh (~300–450g/week) or defrosted from frozen stock (~2,550–2,700g blanched/frozen), cooked fresh daily. The schedule aligns with the 12 PM–8 PM eating window (*USDA*, 2023; *SIGHI*, 2023). The week starts with purchases on Friday, May 9, 2025.
