# Introduction

This cost-optimized 7-day meal plan (Friday to Thursday, May 9–15, 2025), tailored for a 54-year-old male with multiple sclerosis (MS) weighing 63.5 kg, aligns with **The Wahls Protocol** (Wahls Paleo level) to support MS management through nutrient-dense foods, delivering ~102g protein/day (~1.6 g/kg body weight, ~51g/meal), ensuring all 9 essential amino acids (EAAs: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine) and Vitamin B12 (~2.5–3.0µg/day, ~104–125% RDA: 2.4µg). It supports leaky gut repair, constipation, bowel-bladder interactions, acidic sensations, neuropathic pain, post-antibiotic gut issues, and MS-specific needs (e.g., nerve health, inflammation reduction). The plan aligns with the video *"Ultimate Protein Guide: Lose Weight Faster (How Much You REALLY Need)"* ([https://youtu.be/hHkxBEQaZdY](https://youtu.be/hHkxBEQaZdY)), recommending ~1.2–2.0 g/kg protein and emphasizing the 9 EAAs (*Am J Clin Nutr.*, 2015; *Adv Nutr.*, 2017), and incorporates a **16:8 intermittent fasting schedule** (12 PM–8 PM eating window, two meals at 12 PM and 6 PM) based on evidence that fasting reduces inflammation and regulates immunity in MS (*Neurosci News*, 2018; *Nat Commun.*, 2018), with high protein to mitigate muscle loss concerns for those over 40 (*J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci.*, 2017; *J Nutr.*, 2014). The plan uses only whole chicken (for meat and bones) and chicken breasts, with all but one whole chicken frozen upon purchase (Friday) and defrosted strategically to ensure low-histamine compliance (cooked fresh or frozen immediately after cooking). Bone broth (~2800ml, 14 x 200ml portions) is prepared solely from ~1400g bones of two whole chickens, as additional bones cannot be purchased. A detailed schedule guides defrosting and cooking of chicken and bone broth to align with meal consumption. The plan includes ~9 cups/day raw vegetables (~4.5–6 cups cooked, ~600–800g): ~3 cups greens (kale), ~3 cups sulfur-rich (cabbage), ~3 cups colorful (peeled carrots, cucumber, apple), all oxalate-free (<10mg/100g cooked), lectin-free (peeled where needed), and low-FODMAP, plus peeled white potato for starch, and anti-inflammatory fats (olive oil), seasoned with turmeric. Parsley is used sparingly (~25g/week, ~25–37.5mg oxalates, negligible). The morning ritual includes lemon juice for Vitamin C and alkalizing effects. Nutrient-dense foods provide ~340–390mg magnesium/day, ~90–120µg iodine/day, and ~25–30g fiber/day (including resistant starch), supporting constipation, nerve health, and MS symptoms. Some nutrients (iodine, magnesium, calcium, Vitamin D, omega-3s) fall below RDA or AI due to dietary constraints (low-histamine, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP) and cost optimization, requiring monitoring or supplementation (e.g., consult neurologist for Vitamin D, low-histamine fish oil for omega-3s). Bone broth supports gut health per Wahls’ recommendations. The plan adheres to low-FODMAP, low-histamine, lectin-free, and oxalate-free principles, ensuring all ingredients are gluten-free, dairy-free, and aligned with Wahls Protocol (*The Wahls Protocol*, 2020; *Nutrients*, 2019; *J Agric Food Chem.*, 2005). Kale intake (~86g/day cooked, ~0.66–0.73 cups cooked, ~3 cups raw) is safe for oxalates (~0.69–4.81mg/day), goitrogens (~14–21mg/day), fiber (~1.7g/day), and Vitamin K (~275–412µg/day, monitor if on anticoagulants), and contains no Vitamin B12, with B12 sourced from chicken and eggs (*cookingpro.net*, 2023; *Nutrients*, 2018). The journal (Saturday, May 10: cooked 1.6kg whole chicken, 12 AM; ate ~400g chicken meat, 30g kale, 2 eggs, 400g sweet potato, 100g butternut squash, 100g cucumber, no broth/olive oil, felt full; 1:42 PM: 2 eggs, no olive oil) is incorporated, adjusting for whole chicken (~900g meat, ~700g bones), reduced kale, delayed broth/olive oil, and replacing sweet potato with peeled white potato and butternut squash with cabbage. The plan targets a budget of ~£56–£59 (~£8–£8.40/day), optimized from ~£80.61 to ~£54.61 by using cost-effective whole chicken (~£3.31/kg) and chicken breasts (~£6.45/kg), minimizing expensive ingredients (e.g., seaweed snacks, zucchini), including ~£4.70 delivery fee (total ~£59.31, within ~£84.14 receipt).

## Nutritional Standards

The plan meets or exceeds the **Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA)** and **Adequate Intakes (AI)** set by the **National Academy of Medicine (NAM)** for males aged 51–70, aligned with UK dietary reference values (NHS, Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition) and **The Wahls Protocol**’s focus on nutrient density for MS support, adjusted for cost optimization, low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free (<10mg/100g cooked, parsley negligible), low-FODMAP requirements, and intermittent fasting. The **RDA** is the average daily intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97–98%) healthy individuals in a specific age and sex group, as defined by the NAM. The **AI** is a recommended average daily intake level based on observed or experimentally determined estimates, used when an RDA cannot be established, as defined by the NAM. The plan adheres to **low-FODMAP** principles (Monash University) for gut sensitivity, **ketogenic/low-carb** targets (~60–80g carbs/day) for autophagy/mitophagy enhanced by fasting, **low-histamine** and **lectin-free** principles to minimize symptoms, and supports leaky gut repair (glutamine, zinc, prebiotics), constipation (high fiber), inflammation (anti-inflammatory fats, omega-3s), nerve health (magnesium, B12, Vitamin D), and MS mitochondrial function per Wahls Protocol (*The Wahls Protocol*, 2020). Some nutrients fall below RDA/AI due to dietary constraints and cost; these are noted with monitoring recommendations. Key standards include:

- **Protein**: ~102g/day (~1.6 g/kg for 63.5 kg, RDA: 56g, NAM 2005), ~182% RDA, exceeds RDA for muscle, gut, nerve repair, and satiety, ensuring all 9 EAAs (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine) via complete proteins (chicken, eggs) to counter fasting-related muscle loss and support MS per Wahls.
- **Fat**: ~120–150g/day (~70–80% calories), aligns with ketogenic diet and Wahls’ healthy fat focus for autophagy/mitophagy, prioritizing anti-inflammatory fats from olive oil.
- **Carbohydrates**: ~60–80g/day (~35–45g net carbs), supports ketosis, below AI (~130g, NAM 2005) but sufficient for MS energy needs during fasting, with Wahls’ emphasis on vegetable-based carbs.
- **Fiber**: ~25–30g/day (AI: 30g, NAM 2005), slightly below AI due to cost-driven vegetable selection, supports constipation and leaky gut with ~10–12g soluble fiber and ~1–2g/day resistant starch from peeled white potato.
- **Vitamin C**: ~140–160mg/day (156–178% RDA, 90mg, UL: 2000mg), exceeds RDA for gut health, immune support, and Wahls’ antioxidant needs.
- **Potassium**: ~3900–4500mg/day (115–132% AI, 3400mg, UL: none), exceeds AI for hydration, nerve function, and Wahls’ mineral focus.
- **Iodine**: ~90–120µg/day (~60–80% RDA, 150µg, UL: 1100µg), below RDA due to reduced seaweed snacks and non-iodized salt constraint, monitor thyroid function, consider low-histamine iodine sources (e.g., iodized salt if constraint allows).
- **Calcium**: ~390–590mg/day (39–59% RDA, 1000mg, UL: 2500mg), below RDA due to no dairy and vegetable constraints, monitor bone health, consult neurologist for supplementation.
- **Magnesium**: ~340–390mg/day (81–93% RDA, 420mg, UL: 350mg supplemental, none dietary), below RDA due to cost-driven vegetable reduction, monitor nerve health and constipation, consider magnesium-rich low-FODMAP foods (e.g., pumpkin seeds if tolerated).
- **Vitamin B12**: ~2.5–3.0µg/day (~104–125% RDA, 2.4µg, UL: none), meets/exceeds RDA for nerve health critical for MS and Wahls’ B-vitamin focus.
- **Vitamin D**: ~0.8–1.3µg/day (~5–9% RDA, 15µg, UL: 100µg), below RDA, requires monitoring or supplementation for MS support and Wahls’ immune focus, consult neurologist.
- **Vitamin A**: ~800–1000µg/day (~89–111% RDA, 900µg, UL: 3000µg), meets RDA for gut lining repair, immune function, and Wahls’ antioxidant needs.
- **Vitamin K**: ~250–400µg/day (AI: 120µg, UL: none), exceeds AI, safe unless on anticoagulants, monitor for MS patients on warfarin per Wahls’ caution.
- **Zinc**: ~9–13mg/day (82–118% RDA, 11mg, UL: 40mg), meets/exceeds RDA for gut/nerve health and Wahls’ immune support.
- **Iron**: ~1–2mg/day (~13–25% RDA, 8mg, UL: 45mg), below RDA but adequate for males due to low bleeding risk, supports MS nerve health.
- **Sodium**: ~600–800mg/day (46–62% AI, 1300mg, UL: 2300mg), sufficient for low-carb hydration during fasting.
- **Omega-3s (ALA)**: ~0.24–0.34g/day (below AI: 1.6g, UL: none), below AI due to absence of fatty fish/seeds, consider low-histamine fish oil if tolerated for MS inflammation and Wahls’ neuroprotection focus.
- **Anti-Nutrients**: No lectins (peeled vegetables), oxalates (<10mg/100g cooked, parsley ~25–37.5mg/week negligible), phytates, or saponins, maximizing absorption for leaky gut and MS support per Wahls’ clean-eating principles.

## Daily Routine

**Morning Ritual (7 AM)**:
- Warm water with 75ml lemon juice (37.5mg Vitamin C, oxalate-free) + 300ml water (alkalizing, diluted to minimize bladder irritation).
- Hydration: 3L water throughout the day (for stool softening and urine dilution to reduce MS-related bladder urgency during fasting, aligns with Wahls’ hydration focus).
- Non-Dietary: Diaphragmatic breathing (5 min, 2x/day) to relax pelvic floor; stand/walk 5–10 min/hour to improve pelvic circulation, adjusted for MS-related mobility as needed, supporting Wahls’ stress reduction.

**Fasting Schedule**: 16:8 intermittent fasting with a 12 PM–8 PM eating window (fasting 8 PM–12 PM), two meals/day at 12 PM (lunch) and 6 PM (dinner) to distribute ~102g protein (~51g/meal), ~120–150g fat, and ~1500–1600 kcal, supporting MS inflammation reduction and immune regulation (*Neurosci News*, 2018) while meeting Wahls’ nutrient density.

**Non-Dietary Tip**: Use a footstool (e.g., Squatty Potty) during bowel movements to reduce straining and ease bowel-bladder crosstalk, beneficial for MS (*Physiother Res Int.*, 2024). Consult a physiotherapist for tailored positioning aids if mobility is limited, aligning with Wahls’ holistic approach.

**Store Notes**: All items at Morrisons. Non-iodized sea salt (e.g., Maldon Sea Salt Flakes), olive oil, lemons, cucumber, peeled zucchini, parsley, peeled white potato, kale (150g bags), peeled carrots, cabbage, apple, whole chicken, chicken breasts, eggs, seaweed snacks, turmeric in Seasonings Aisle, Oil Aisle, Fresh Produce Aisle, Fresh Meat Aisle, International Aisle, Spices Aisle. Peel zucchini, carrots, potato before cooking to ensure lectin-free compliance.

## Defrosting and Cooking Schedule

To ensure low-histamine compliance, all chicken (except one whole chicken refrigerated for next-day cooking) is frozen upon purchase. Defrosting occurs in the refrigerator (24–48 hours for a 1.6kg whole chicken, 24 hours for ~500g chicken breasts) to maintain safety. Excess cooked meat and bone broth are frozen immediately to prevent histamine formation. The schedule aligns defrosting, cooking, and consumption of whole chicken meat, chicken breasts, and bone broth with the 12 PM–8 PM eating window (*USDA*, 2023; *SIGHI*, 2023). Bone broth (~2800ml, 14 x 200ml portions) is prepared from ~1400g bones of two whole chickens (Sunday preparation). The week starts with purchases on Friday, May 9, 2025, and meals from Friday, May 9, to Thursday, May 15, 2025, supporting Wahls’ fresh food emphasis.

## Notes

- **Wahls Protocol Alignment**: Adheres to Wahls Paleo level with ~9 cups/day raw vegetables (~600–800g cooked: ~3 cups kale [greens], ~3 cups cabbage [sulfur-rich], ~3 cups peeled carrots/cucumber/peeled white potato/apple [colorful]), ~102g/day quality protein (whole chicken, chicken breasts, eggs), and healthy fats (olive oil), all gluten-free, dairy-free, and aligned with low-histamine, lectin-free, oxalate-free, low-FODMAP constraints. Bone broth (~2800ml, Monday–Thursday) supports gut health. No organ meats or fermented foods due to histamine risk and budget. Fasting (16:8) is compatible, ensuring nutrient density (*The Wahls Protocol*, 2020).
- **Nutrients Below RDA**:
  - **Iodine**: ~90–120µg/day (~60–80% RDA: 150µg). Risk: Potential thyroid dysfunction, impacting MS energy. Recommendation: Monitor thyroid function (TSH, T4), consider low-histamine iodine sources (e.g., iodized salt if non-iodized constraint allows) or consult endocrinologist (*Nutrients*, 2020).
  - **Magnesium**: ~340–390mg/day (81–93% RDA: 420mg). Risk: Impaired nerve health, increased MS spasticity, constipation. Recommendation: Monitor nerve symptoms, consider magnesium-rich low-FODMAP foods (e.g., pumpkin seeds if tolerated) or consult neurologist for supplementation (*Nutrients*, 2017; *J Neurol.*, 2019).
  - **Calcium**: ~390–590mg/day (39–59% RDA: 1000mg). Risk: Potential bone health issues, exacerbated by low Vitamin D. Recommendation: Monitor bone health, consult neurologist for supplementation (*Mult Scler.*, 2017).
  - **Vitamin D**: ~0.8–1.3µg/day (~5–9% RDA: 15µg). Risk: Increased MS relapse risk, impaired immune function. Recommendation: Consult neurologist for supplementation (e.g., 1000–4000 IU/day, low-histamine source), monitor serum 25(OH)D levels (*Neurology*, 2018).
  - **Omega-3s (ALA)**: ~0.24–0.34g/day (below AI: 1.6g). Risk: Increased inflammation, reduced MS neuroprotection. Recommendation: Consider low-histamine fish oil if tolerated, consult neurologist (*J Neurol.*, 2019).
- **Oxalate-Free Compliance**: All ingredients are oxalate-free (<10mg/100g cooked): kale (~1–7mg), peeled zucchini (~1–2mg), peeled carrots (~2–5mg), peeled white potato (~5–8mg), cabbage (~
