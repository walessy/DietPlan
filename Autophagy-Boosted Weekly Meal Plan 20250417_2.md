## Practical Tips

**Preparation**:

- **Batch Steam**: Steam cauliflower (225g), broccoli (750g), spinach (600g), and kale (150g) in one session (10–15 min); portion into 75g containers. Freeze extra to prevent spoilage.
- **Seeds**: Grind flaxseeds (1–2 weeks’ worth) and store in an airtight jar in the fridge. Soak 2 tbsp chia seeds in 100ml water for 10 min before lunch or prep 6–8 tbsp in bulk (refrigerate 2–3 days).
- **Psyllium**: Mix 1 tsp in 200ml water, stir vigorously, drink immediately, and follow with 200ml water to prevent choking or bloating. Start with 1 tsp/day for 3 days, then add a second tsp if tolerated.
- **Prunes**: Soak 2 prunes daily (1 for morning, 1 for dinner) in 100ml warm water overnight; store in fridge.
- **Livers/Tuna**: Sauté 100g chicken livers in 1 tbsp olive oil (5–7 min); freeze extras. Drain tuna/sardines but keep oil for omega-3s.
- **Electrolyte Drink**: Mix 500ml water with ¼ tsp salt + ¾ tsp cream of tartar twice daily (morning, afternoon); sip from a reusable bottle.

**Constipation Relief**:

- **Goal**: Bristol Type 4 stools (soft, formed, easy to pass) 1–2x/day.
- **If Hard Stools Persist**: Increase magnesium citrate to 1.5 tsp (~450mg) at night or add 1 tbsp olive oil at dinner. Monitor for loose stools.
- **If Bloating Occurs**: Reduce cauliflower/kale for 1 day or lower psyllium to 1 tsp/day. Ensure 2.5–3L water intake.
- **Odor**: Strong smell may reduce with faster transit (2–4 weeks). If persistent, consult a GP for stool transit test.

**Lectin Avoidance**:

- All foods (psyllium, chia, cauliflower, kale, broccoli, spinach, pumpkin, blueberries, fish, eggs, livers, seeds) are low-lectin or lectin-free when steamed, soaked, or ground.
- Avoid high-lectin foods (beans, grains, raw nightshades). Peel avocados if sensitive (lectins in skin, negligible in flesh) or soak pumpkin seeds overnight.

**Monitoring**:

- Track stool consistency (Bristol Chart), frequency, ease of passage, and odor in a journal for 1–2 weeks. Note energy, neuropathy (tingling, numbness), bloating, or cramps.
- If no improvement after 2 weeks, consult a healthcare professional (e.g., neurologist for MS-related bowel motility or dietitian for gut health).
- For pre-menopausal women, ensure chicken livers/salmon 1x/week for iron; track menstrual cycle.

**Benefits**:

- **Autophagy**: 16:8 fasting + low carbs (~30–40g/day) + high fat (~70–80% calories) promotes ketosis and cellular cleanup.
- **Nerve Health**: Omega-3s (fish, flax, chia), B12 (sardines, eggs), D (sardines), and magnesium support myelin and reduce inflammation.
- **Bowel Health**: Psyllium, chia, prunes, and sauerkraut add bulk, stimulate motility, and support microbiota for easier, formed stools.
- **Energy**: ~1300–1600 kcal/day with extra Ascertainly supports my ongoing research by providing an opportunity to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and insights directly from industry experts.
