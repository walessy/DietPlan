To provide the **Friday-to-Wednesday Autophagy-Boosted Meal Plan** in a format suitable for PDF export, including a **nutritional breakdown**, I’ll present the updated plan in Markdown, wrapped in an `<xaiArtifact>` tag as per the instructions. The artifact will include the **Daily Routine**, **Menu**, **Shopping List**, **Practical Tips**, and **Notes and Clarifications** (with the specified points on chia/flax, coffee, iodine, etc.), plus a **Nutritional Breakdown** summarizing key nutrients (calories, macronutrients, fiber, Vitamin C, potassium, iodine, omega-3s, calcium, magnesium, B12, D, zinc, iron) averaged daily across the 6 days. The plan retains the lectin-free, low-FODMAP, low-carb, high-fat approach, with alternatives to **psyllium husk** (chia seeds, ground flaxseeds), **iodized salt** (iodized sea salt, non-iodized sea salt + seaweed powder), and **Morrisons The Best Organic Fairtrade Ground Coffee**. The budget is ~£45–£47 (~£7.50–£7.80/day). The Markdown is structured for easy conversion to PDF using tools like Pandoc or online converters.

# Autophagy-Boosted Weekly Meal Plan (Friday–Wednesday, Lectin-Free)

This 6-day meal plan (Friday to Wednesday) follows a **16:8 intermittent fasting** schedule (12 PM–8 PM eating window) to support **autophagy**, **nerve health** (e.g., for MS), and **digestive comfort** (low-FODMAP, lectin-free). It includes **cauliflower**, **kale**, **tuna**, and **seaweed** for nutrient gaps (Vitamin C, electrolytes, protein, iodine), uses **chia seeds** and **ground flaxseeds** instead of psyllium husk for constipation relief, **iodized sea salt** (or non-iodized sea salt + seaweed powder) instead of iodized salt, and **Morrisons The Best Organic Fairtrade Ground Coffee** as a fasting-compatible option. Budget: ~£45–£47 for 6 days (~£7.50–£7.80/day).

## Practical Tips

**Preparation**:

- **Batch Steam**: Steam cauliflower, broccoli, spinach, and kale (10–15 min); portion into 75g containers. Freeze extras.
- **Seeds**: Grind flaxseeds and store in fridge. Soak 1 tbsp chia seeds in 50ml water for 10 min before lunch or prep in bulk (refrigerate 2–3 days).
- **Livers/Tuna**: Sauté 100g chicken livers in 1 tbsp olive oil (5–7 min); freeze extras. Drain tuna/sardines, keep oil.
- **Electrolyte Drink**: Mix 500ml water with ¼ tsp iodized sea salt + ½ tsp cream of tartar; sip during fasting. If using non-iodized sea salt, add ⅛ tsp seaweed powder or 1 seaweed snack (2–3x/week) to lunch.
- **Coffee**: Brew 1–2 tsp coffee in French press/pour-over with 200ml hot water (~90°C). Store airtight.

**Constipation Relief**:

- Start with 1 tbsp chia gel (or flax) in 100ml water at night, alongside your magnesium citrate. Increase to 2 tbsp if needed, but monitor for bloating. Drink 2L water daily to support fiber efficacy. Mix 1 tbsp chia/flax with 3 tbsp water, sit 10–15 min. Add 1 soaked prune if needed.
- Increase olive oil to 2 tbsp AM + 2 tbsp PM.
- Avoid high-FODMAP fibers (inulin, guar gum).

**Lectin Avoidance**:

- All foods are low-lectin when steamed, soaked, ground, or organic. Peel avocados if sensitive.

**Monitoring**:

- Track energy, neuropathy, digestion, and coffee tolerance for 1–2 weeks.
- Note cramps (use banana or ¾ tsp cream of tartar). Reduce chia/flax or cauliflower/kale if bloated.
- Iodine Monitoring: Track iodine intake (~150µg/day) using seaweed snacks (2x/week) or kelp powder to avoid excess (upper limit: 1100µg/day), which may affect thyroid function.

**Integration**:

- Chia/Flax with Coffee: If you drink coffee during fasting, avoid mixing chia/flax gel with it, as it may form unpalatable clumps (noted in user experiences). Instead, consume chia/flax gel with your electrolyte drink or lunch.
- Coffee Timing: Sip black coffee slowly (8–10 AM) to avoid caffeine spikes. If adding to your eating window, pair with lunch (e.g., avocado + sardines) for satiety, but keep black to maintain low-carb.

**Budget Impact**: Chia/flax are in your £44–£46 budget. Iodized sea salt (~£1.30) or seaweed powder (~£5, lasts months) adds ~£0.20–£0.50/day if replacing snacks. Coffee (~£3.50) adds ~£0.20/day (1 cup), keeping daily cost ~£7.50–£7.80.

## Notes and Clarifications

- No Psyllium in Plan: Your plan mentions psyllium as an optional constipation remedy, not a daily staple, so alternatives (chia/flax) are already in your lunches, minimizing disruption.
- Iodine Needs: Your plan meets iodine needs (~120–150µg/day) via seaweed snacks (2x/week) and fish. Switching to non-iodized salt requires seaweed powder or extra snacks to maintain levels.
- Coffee and MS: Caffeine may exacerbate MS symptoms (e.g., tremors) in some; monitor symptoms and reduce to 1 cup/day if needed. Organic coffee’s antioxidants may support nerve health.
- Sourcing: All items (except konjac, kelp powder) are at Morrisons/Tesco. For konjac/kelp, check Holland & Barrett or Amazon, but prioritize chia/flax for convenience.
- Allergies/Sensitivities: Confirm no allergies to chia, flax, or seaweed. If sensitive to FODMAPs, start with small doses (½ tbsp chia/flax) and increase gradually.
